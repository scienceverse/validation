However, outcomes also vary a lot and may depend on many different factors. In this study, we examined the level of functioning and happiness of 917 adults with autism (425 men and 492 women) aged 18-65 years. Most of them were of average to high intellectual ability. Over 6 years, we measured whether they had a paid job, close friendships and lived on their own (i.e. their objective functioning). We also measured how happy they felt. Objectively, most autistic adults did fairly to very well. Those with better objective outcomes (e.g. those with paid work) also tended to be happier. Most adults improved in objective functioning and happiness over 6 years. Participants with a lower intellectual ability, more autism traits, mental health problems and younger age had poorer objective outcomes. Participants with more autism traits and mental health problems were less happy. Autistic men and women functioned at similar levels and were equally happy. We found important factors that predict a better (or worse) outcome for autistic adults. Overall, compared with some previous research, our findings give a more positive picture of the outcomes for autistic adults with average to high intellectual abilities.",We would like to thank all of our loyal participants from the Netherlands Autism Register (NAR).,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Female; Friends; Happiness; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Male; Middle Aged; Young Adult,25/06/2021,2021,25/06/2021,2022-01,26,1,243-255,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Scheeren, Anke M; Buil, J Marieke; Howlin, Patricia; Bartels, Meike; Begeer, Sander","Scheeren, Anke M (VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Buil, J Marieke (VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Howlin, Patricia (King’s College London, UK); Bartels, Meike (VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Begeer, Sander (VU University Amsterdam, The Netherlands)","Scheeren, Anke M (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)","Scheeren, Anke M (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Buil, J Marieke (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Howlin, Patricia (King's College London); Bartels, Meike (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Begeer, Sander (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)",King's College London; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,grid.13097.3c; grid.12380.38,United Kingdom; Netherlands,Dutch Research Council; European Research Council,3,3,,,25,https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211027673,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139149080,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,Yes,https://osf.io/gt38c,Secondary Analysis,

We investigated if attention-based cognitive behavioral treatment, based on mindfulness cognitive therapy (MBCT) and dialectical behavior therapy (DBT), reduces aggressive behavior and improves anger coping in school-aged autistic children (n = 51). Children were randomized to an active-control or a treatment condition. The treatment included nine weekly sessions attention-based individual therapy. Parents in both conditions received three weekly psychoeducation group sessions to heighten awareness of expressed emotion (EE). For aggressive behavior, treatment reduced temper tantrums and arguing. No effect was found on destroying things and physical violence. For anger coping, treatment increased adaptive coping strategies of diffusion and social support seeking, but had no effect on assertion, rumination, and maladaptive coping direct anger out and avoidance. Treatment did not impact secondary outcome measures concerning children's quality of life (QoL) and parental stress-levels and psychological well-being. In conclusion, school-aged autistic children are able to acquire self-regulation skills reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing the use of adaptive anger coping strategies. The intervention shows potential to improve behavior and regulation, but little transfer to other domains. Limitations and future directions involving the child's social environment, including parents, siblings, and teachers are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: Children on the autism spectrum often show aggressive behavior. Treatment can train children to be more aware of their emotions. This study found that this can help reducing temper tantrums and arguing and increasing some coping skills, though no impact was found on several other domains of aggression and coping.","Sander Begeer received Research Grants ZonMW (The Netherlands) Grant Number 70‐72900‐98‐14050.

In our study, we recorded the eye movements of autistic and typically developing adults while they engaged in a real-life social interaction with a partner. Results showed that autistic adults were less likely than typically developing adults to look at the experimenter's face, and instead were more likely to look at the background. Moreover, the perspective that was adopted in the conversation (talking about self versus others) modulated the patterns of eye movements in autistic and non-autistic adults. Overall, people spent less time looking at their conversation partner's eyes and face and more time looking at the background, when talking about an unfamiliar other compared to when talking about themselves. This pattern was magnified among autistic adults. We conclude that allocating attention to social information during conversation is cognitively effortful, but this can be mitigated when talking about a topic that is familiar to them.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Communication; Eye Movements; Face; Humans,09/07/2020,2020,09/07/2020,2020-11,24,8,2153-2165,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Barzy, Mahsa; Ferguson, Heather J; Williams, David M","Barzy, Mahsa (University of Kent, UK); Ferguson, Heather J (University of Kent, UK); Williams, David M (University of Kent, UK)","Ferguson, Heather J (University of Kent)","Barzy, Mahsa (University of Kent); Ferguson, Heather J (University of Kent); Williams, David M (University of Kent)",University of Kent,grid.9759.2,United Kingdom,,4,4,0.45,2.07,7,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320936820,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129108507,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,Yes,https://osf.io/6n8hk,Experiment,

Co-occurrence of epilepsy in autistic individuals often aggravated cognitive impairment and increased the risk of poor long-term prognosis. Thus, an updated systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted to study the relevant articles published from inception to 2020, evaluate the prevalence of epilepsy in autistic individuals, and further explore the putative factors influencing the prevalence. A total of 66 studies from 53 articles were included in this study. The results showed that epilepsy is more common in autistic individuals than in the general population. The prevalence of epilepsy in autistic individuals in the clinical sample-based studies was higher than that in the population-based based cross-sectional or cohort studies. The prevalence of epilepsy in autistic adults was higher than that in autistic children. A significantly increased prevalence of epilepsy was detected in the autistic adolescent group (11-17 years old), and a higher trend of prevalence of epilepsy was observed in the autistic pre-school group (⩽ 6 -years-old) than that of the autistic school-aged group (7-10 years-old). The prevalence of epilepsy increased with age, female rate, and low intellectual function rate of autistic individuals. However, the human development index of countries was negatively associated with the pooled prevalence, which could be attributed to the different levels of awareness, diagnostic technologies, and autism-service support worldwide. About 1/10 autistic individuals also had epilepsy, which was common in the clinical setting, adolescents, adults, females, or patients with intellectual disability and less common in the country with high human development index. Thus, these findings provided critical and innovative views on the prevalence of epilepsy in autistic individuals and contributed to the targeted clinical management and preventive measures.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Adolescent; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Epilepsy; Female; Humans; Prevalence",13/09/2021,2021,13/09/2021,2022-01,26,1,33-50,Closed,Article,"Liu, Xian; Sun, Xin; Sun, Caihong; Zou, Mingyang; Chen, Yiru; Huang, Junping; Wu, Lijie; Chen, Wen-Xiong","Liu, Xian (Guangzhou Medical University, China; Harbin Medical University, China); Sun, Xin (Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China); Sun, Caihong (Harbin Medical University, China); Zou, Mingyang (Harbin Medical University, China); Chen, Yiru (Guangzhou Medical University, China); Huang, Junping (Tianjin Medical University, China); Wu, Lijie (Harbin Medical University, China); Chen, Wen-Xiong (Guangzhou Medical University, China)","Chen, Wen-Xiong (Guangzhou Medical University)","Liu, Xian (Guangzhou Medical University; Harbin Medical University); Sun, Xin (Shanghai Jiao Tong University); Sun, Caihong (Harbin Medical University); Zou, Mingyang (Harbin Medical University); Chen, Yiru (Guangzhou Medical University); Huang, Junping (Tianjin Medical University); Wu, Lijie (Harbin Medical University); Chen, Wen-Xiong (Guangzhou Medical University)",Shanghai Jiao Tong University; Guangzhou Medical University; Tianjin Medical University; Harbin Medical University,grid.16821.3c; grid.410737.6; grid.265021.2; grid.410736.7,China; China; China; China,,9,9,,,15,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1141077596,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=179725,Systematic Review,

Unfortunately, the available evidence about the effectiveness of these interventions remains unclear. Several reviews have focused on the published findings rather than contacting the authors to collect and analyse data about the individual participants in the original studies. Also, most of the studies were carried out by groups involved in delivering the interventions leading to the potential bias in interpreting the results. Our research team (supported by an international advisory group) carried out an independent individual patient data review by collecting the original participant data from the authors of the studies, to examine the effectiveness of these interventions. The results suggested that early intensive applied behaviour analysis-based interventions might lead to some changes in children's cognitive ability (intelligence quotient) and everyday life skills after 2 years, compared with standard treatments. However, all the studies had problems with the way they were designed. Also, few of the studies looked at outcomes that have been described as most important to autistic people or followed children beyond 2 years. We think that further systematic reviews of the existing evidence are unlikely to add to the findings of our review. Furthermore, we recommend that future research should investigate which types of supports and interventions are most effective for children and families, prioritising outcomes measures that are meaningful for the autism community and include, wherever possible, longer-term follow-up.","The authors would like to thank Mike Clarke, Bernard Fleming, Patricia Howlin, Emma Jenner, Helen McConachie, Anne McLaren, Dean McMillan, Damian Milton, Roo Philip, Peter Szatmari, Emma Truelove, Colin Wilson, Anne-Marie Wood and Suzy Yardley who all provided support as part of our Advisory Group.

Therefore, little is known about menstruation and menopause in autism spectrum conditions. Some smaller studies indicate that autistic individuals might suffer from increased difficulties surrounding these events. This study aimed to investigate whether autistic women experience more frequent premenstrual dysphoric disorder, causing extreme physical, emotional, and functional impairment. In a partly overlapping sample, we also examined whether women with autism spectrum condition experience increased complaints surrounding menopause. We did not find an increased prevalence of premenstrual dysphoric disorder in autism spectrum conditions (14.3%) compared with non-autistic women (9.5%). Those with autism spectrum conditions did experience increased menopausal complaints. These menopausal complaints were associated with higher levels of depression and autistic traits. In non-autistic women, menopausal complaints were associated with increased inattention, hyperactivity/impulsivity (i.e. attention deficit hyperactivity disorder traits), and depression.

In this study, we examined continuity and change in loneliness and stress, and their predictors, in 448 autistic and 70 non-autistic adults living in the Netherlands. Autistic participants were assessed on three occasions using the de Jong Gierveld Loneliness Scale and Perceived Stress Scale (pre-lockdown (T0), first lockdown (T1), and second lockdown (T2)); non-autistic participants were assessed twice (T1 and T2). Autistic adults' loneliness and stress levels remained stable across all three time points over 8 months, but were consistently higher than those of non-autistic adults. Other predictors of higher loneliness and stress levels at the first lockdown (T1) included low perceived social support and high levels of COVID-19 related worries. Although loneliness and stress were stable at the group level, the wellbeing of some autistic adults worsened over the course of the pandemic, while others improved. For instance, adults with a mental health diagnosis (other than autism) prior to the pandemic were more likely to increase in stress over time, whereas adults with higher perceived social support were more likely to decrease in stress over time (from T1 to T2). Factors contributing to variability in outcome require further examination. Moreover, the relatively high loneliness and stress levels in autistic adults call for attention from clinicians and service providers. LAY SUMMARY: In our study, autistic adults reported feeling more lonely and stressed than non-autistic adults during the COVID-19 pandemic. People who missed support from their social network also felt more lonely and stressed. On average, people did not change substantially in their degree of loneliness or stress over time. Yet, we noted large person-to-person differences in the wellbeing of autistic adults during the pandemic.","We would like to thank all of our loyal participants from the Netherlands Autism Register (NAR), who were willing to participate during unusual pandemic times.

Toe walking (TW) is a phenomenon that can be found in ASD subjects during gait, even if this condition was found not to be necessarily related only to walking, since these children often also stand and run on their tiptoes. Since persistent TW in ASD subjects may contribute to secondary shortening of the Achilles's tendon, it becomes important to have an assessment tool and/or outcome measure for both the clinical and rehabilitative settings. The aim of this systematic review is to critically evaluate and describe the methods employed to assess toe walking in ASD subjects. The systematic review protocol was previously registered on PROSPERO. We conducted an extensive literature search in PubMed, CINAHL, PsycINFO, The Cochrane Library, and Scopus databases. There were no restrictions on the types of study design eligible for inclusion. Ten studies were included in the systematic review. Risk of bias of the included studies was conducted using the following instruments depending on the study types: STROBE Statement, Cochrane risk of bias tool, and CARE checklist. Almost all the included studies (8/10) proposed a tip-toe behavior (TTB) assessment only during walking. Nine out of ten of the included studies assessed TTB using a qualitative methodology. The results evidenced the heterogeneity of qualitative methods and a lack of a structured quantitative test to assess toe walking in ASD subjects.

In this pre-registered study, 30 autistic children aged 6-14 years and 30 typically developing children matched in age and non-verbal IQ completed visual extrapolation and false memory tasks to assess predictive abilities and contextual processing, respectively. In the visual extrapolation tasks, children were asked to predict when an occluded car would reach the end of a road and when an occluded set of lights would fill up a grid. Autistic children made predictions that were just as precise as those made by typically developing children, across a range of occlusion durations. In the false memory task, autistic and typically developing children did not differ significantly in their discrimination between items presented in a list and semantically related, non-presented items, although the data were insensitive, suggesting the need for larger samples. Our findings help to refine theoretical accounts by challenging the notion that autism is caused by pervasively disordered prediction abilities. Further studies will be required to assess the relationship between predictive processing and context use in autism, and to establish the conditions under which predictive processing may be impaired.

LAY SUMMARY: It has been suggested that autistic individuals have difficulties making predictions and perceiving the overall gist of things. Yet, here we found that autistic children made similar predictions about hidden objects as non-autistic children. In a memory task, autistic children were slightly less confused about whether they had heard a word before, when words were closely related in meaning. We conclude that autistic children do not show difficulties with this type of prediction.","This research was supported financially by the Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford.

We also investigated whether effects varied as a function of specific features of the intervention, samples, and outcomes measured. Twenty-seven studies testing the effects of NDBIs were extracted from data collected for the Autism Intervention Meta-analysis (Project AIM), a comprehensive meta-analysis of group design, nonpharmacological intervention studies for children with autism aged 0-8 years. We extracted effect sizes for 454 outcomes from these studies for use in meta-regression analyses testing associations between intervention effects and mean participant chronological age, language age, autism symptomatology, percentage of sample reported as male, cumulative intervention intensity, interventionist, outcome boundedness, outcome proximity, and risk of parent/teacher training correlated measurement error. The extant literature on NDBIs documents effects on social communication, language, play, and cognitive outcomes. However, our confidence in the positive and significant summary effects for these domains is somewhat limited by methodological concerns. Intervention effects were larger for context-bound outcomes (relative to generalized), and for proximal outcomes (relative to distal). Our results indicate that NDBIs have promise as an approach for supporting development for some, but not all of the core and related features of autism in early childhood. Confidence in summary effect estimates is limited by study quality concerns, particularly an overreliance on measures subject to high detection bias. The results of this review support the use of proximity and boundedness as indicators of the limits of intervention effects. LAY SUMMARY: Naturalistic Developmental Behavioral Interventions may increase language, social communication, play skills, and cognition in young children with autism, but these increases are largest for skills directly targeted by the intervention, and in contexts that are similar to that of the intervention. These conclusions are tempered by some concerns regarding research design across the studies that have been conducted to date.

However, under specific conditions, it could affect significantly fetal brain development. Few studies, with inconsistent results, investigated whether fever, regardless the pathogen, could represent a risk factor for neurodevelopmental disorders (NDD) in the offspring. We aimed to explore further this question by performing a systematic review and meta-analysis.MethodsPeer-reviewed studies exploring the occurrence of NDD in offspring after a fetal exposure to maternal fever were included. We specifically considered the impact of fever severity and duration, taking into consideration some confounding variables such as the use of antipyretic during pregnancy, the trimester in which the fever arose, the maternal age or smoking at time of gestation. MEDLINE, EMBASE, PsycINFO, Cochrane and Web of Science were searched without language restriction. PRISMA recommendations were followed. Odds ratio (OR) were pooled using random-effects meta-analysis. Heterogeneity in effect size across studies was studied using random-effects meta-regression analysis. (PROSPERO CRD42020182801).ResultsWe finally considered ten studies gathering a total of 10,304 children with NDD. Among them, 1394 were exposed to fever during pregnancy. The selected studies were divided into 5 case–control studies and 5 cohort studies. Maternal exposure to fever during pregnancy increased the risk of NDD in offspring with an OR of 1.24 [95% CI: 1.12–1.38]. Secondary analysis revealed an increased risk for NDD when fever occurred during the first trimester of gestation [OR 1.13–95% CI: 1.02–1.26].LimitationsWe excluded studies that considered infections with no evidence of fever. Another potential limitation may be the possible heterogeneity between study designs (cohorts and case–control).ConclusionAdditional evidence supported the association between fever during pregnancy and increased risk for NDD in offspring. Careful monitoring should be considered for children born from mothers with a febrile episode during pregnancy (specifically during the first trimester).","The authors would like to thank the following authors who kindly provided additional unpublished information/data: A.

18,3632,pub.1038537768,10.1002/aur.1692,27651096,,,Beyond the hype and hope: Critical considerations for intranasal oxytocin research in autism spectrum disorder,"Extensive research efforts in the last decade have been expended into understanding whether intranasal oxytocin may be an effective therapeutic in treating social communication impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After much hyped early findings, subsequent clinical trials of longer-term administration have yielded more conservative and mixed evidence. However, it is still unclear at this stage whether these more disappointing findings reflect a true null effect or are mitigated by methodological differences masking true effects. In this review, we comprehensively evaluate the rationale for oxytocin as a therapeutic, evaluating evidence from randomized controlled trials, case reports, and open-label studies of oxytocin administration in individuals with ASD. The evidence to date, including reviews of preregistered trials, suggests a number of critical considerations for the design and interpretation of research in this area. These include considering the choice of ASD outcome measures, dosing and nasal spray device issues, and participant selection. Despite these limitations in the field to date, there remains significant potential for oxytocin to ameliorate aspects of the persistent and debilitating social impairments in individuals with ASD. Given the considerable media hype around new treatments for ASD, as well as the needs of eager families, there is an urgent need for researchers to prioritise considering such factors when conducting well-designed and controlled studies to further advance this field.

Additionally, popular media has widely circulated claims that such devices and academic software applications offer tremendous educational benefits. A systematic search identified 19 studies that targeted academic skills for individuals with autism. Most studies used the device’s built-in video recording or camera function to create customized teaching materials, rather than commercially-available applications. Analysis of potential moderating variables indicated that participants’ age and functioning level did not influence outcomes. However, participant operation of the device, as opposed to operation by an instructor, produced significantly larger effect size estimates. Results are discussed in terms of recommendations for practitioners and future research.","The research described in this article was supported in part by Grant H325H140001 from the Office of Special Education Programs, U.S. Department of Education.

The current study systematically reviewed and meta-analyzed the extant literature comparing interoceptive outcomes between autistic (AUT) and neurotypical (NT) individuals, determining which domains of interoception demonstrate robust between-group differences. A three-level Bayesian meta-analysis compared heartbeat counting performance, heartbeat discrimination performance, heartbeat counting confidence ratings, and self-reported interoceptive attention between AUT and NT groups (15 studies; nAUT = 467, nNT = 478). Autistic participants showed significantly reduced heartbeat counting performance [g = − 0.333, CrI95% (− 0.535, − 0.138)] and higher confidence in their heartbeat counting abilities [g = 0.430, CrI95% (0.123, 0.750)], but groups were equivalent on other meta-analyzed outcomes.

As these studies substantially differ in their methodology, replication studies are needed. In this replication study frequentist (i.e., null-hypothesis significance testing), and Bayesian statistics were used to investigate the hypothesis that in autistic adults compared to non-autistic adults mostly parallel, but also protective age-related cognitive effects can be observed. Participants were 88 autistic adults, and 88 non-autistic matched comparisons (age range: 30-89 years, mean age: 55 years). Cognitive measures were administered on the following six domains: verbal memory, visual memory, working memory, Theory of Mind (ToM), verbal fluency, and processing speed, and self-reported cognitive failures. Non-autistic adults outperformed autistic adults on ToM, verbal fluency, and verbal memory, but only the first two were confirmed with Bayesian replication analyses. Also, more cognitive failures were reported by autistic adults. No interactions between group and age were observed, suggesting a parallel age-related effect on all cognitive domains. In sum, previously observed difficulties in ToM and verbal fluency were replicated which seem to persist at older age. Previously reported parallel age-related cognitive patterns were replicated, yet no evidence for protective age-related patterns was found. LAY SUMMARY: We investigated whether our previous findings on cognitive aging in autism could be confirmed in a new study measuring the cognitive effects of age in autistic and non-autistic adults. As expected, tasks that younger autistic adults had difficulties with (theory of mind, fluency) were also difficult for older autistic adults, and the effect of age itself was similar in autistic and non-autistic adults. Unexpectedly, we observed no protective effects (less cognitive aging) in autism.","This study would not have been possible without the help of many people.

Controlling for core language ability, autistic participants (N = 66) were over twice as likely to endorse a non-normative interpretation of an implied meaning and over five times as likely to select ""do not know"" when asked about the presence of an implied meaning, compared to non-autistic participants (N = 118). A further experiment suggested that the selection of ""do not know"" reflected a cognitive preference for certainty and explicit communication, and that the normative inference could often be made when the test format was more constrained. Our research supports the hypothesis that autistic individuals can find it challenging to process language in its pragmatic context, and that cognitive preferences play a role in this. LAY SUMMARY: We investigated differences between autistic and non-autistic people in understanding implied meanings in conversation. We found that autistic people were more likely to select a different interpretation of implied meanings compared to other people, and also much more likely to avoid processing implied meanings when the task allowed this. Our research supports the view that autistic people can find it challenging to process indirect meanings, and that they tend to prefer explicit forms of communication.","Our warmest thanks to all the participants who made this research happen, and also to Autistica for their generous help with recruitment.

This may be due, in part, to a lack of workplace accommodations being made for autistic people. One factor that may contribute to employment inequalities in autistic people is differences in attitudes towards interpersonal touch. This study acts as a preliminary investigation into whether employed autistic and non-autistic participants differ in their attitudes towards touch in the workplace, and in their loneliness and wellbeing. The current dataset was drawn from a larger online survey (the Touch Test) designed to explore attitudes and experiences towards touch. We found that employed autistic participants had more negative attitudes to general, social and workplace touch relative to non-autistic participants. Autistic participants also experienced greater loneliness and reduced wellbeing. Attachment-related anxiety was the only significant predictor of wellbeing in employed autistic adults. However, attachment-related anxiety, general attitudes to touch and the role of touch in the workplace predicted wellbeing in employed non-autistic adults. With regards to loneliness, general attitudes to touch and the role of touch in the workplace predicted loneliness in autistic participants. We also replicated the finding that a greater proportion of autistic participants were unemployed relative to non-autistic participants.

Filik et al. showed that initially, participants expected the victim to be more hurt by ironic comments than literal, but later considered them less hurtful; ironic comments were regarded as more amusing. We examined these processes in autistic adults, since previous research has demonstrated socio-emotional difficulties among autistic people, which may lead to problems processing irony and its related emotional processes despite an intact ability to integrate language in context. We recorded eye movements from autistic and nonautistic adults while they read narratives in which a character (the victim) was either criticized in an ironic or a literal manner by another character (the protagonist). A target sentence then either described the victim as feeling hurt/amused by the comment, or the protagonist as having intended to hurt/amused the victim by making the comment. Results from the nonautistic adults broadly replicated the key findings from Filik et al., supporting the two-stage account. Importantly, the autistic adults did not show comparable two-stage processing of ironic language; they did not differentiate between the emotional responses for victims or protagonists following ironic versus literal criticism. These findings suggest that autistic people experience a specific difficulty taking into account other peoples' communicative intentions (i.e., infer their mental state) to appropriately anticipate emotional responses to an ironic comment. We discuss how these difficulties might link to atypical socio-emotional processing in autism, and the ability to maintain successful real-life social interactions.

LAY SUMMARY: In line with research showing that autistic people have difficulties considering others' mental states, we found autistic adults were impaired at distinguishing the emotions and intentions experienced by story characters who received sarcastic comments (e.g., ""That was fantastic parking"" in a context where someone's parking was particularly bad). These findings highlight the difficulties that autistic people experience taking into account other peoples' intentions during communication to appropriately anticipate their emotional responses. © 2020 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.",This work was carried out with the support of a grant to H.J.F. and D.W. from the Leverhulme Trust (Ref.: RPG‐2014‐298).,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Comprehension; Emotions; Eye Movements; Eye-Tracking Technology; Female; Humans; Male; Mental Processes; Reading,04/02/2020,2020,04/02/2020,2020-04,13,4,563-578,All OA; Green,Article,"Barzy, Mahsa; Filik, Ruth; Williams, David; Ferguson, Heather J.","Barzy, Mahsa (School of Psychology, University of Kent, UK); Filik, Ruth (School of Psychology, University of Nottingham, UK); Williams, David (School of Psychology, University of Kent, UK); Ferguson, Heather J.

The current meta-analysis investigated whether slower processing speed is associated with the ASD neurocognitive profile and whether findings hold across different time-based tasks and stimuli (social vs. nonsocial; linguistic vs. nonlinguistic). Mean RTs of ASD and age-matched neurotypical comparison groups (N = 893 ASD, 1063 neurotypical; mean age ASD group = 17 years) were compared across simple RT, choice RT, and interference control tasks (44 studies, 106 effects) using robust variance estimation meta-analysis. Simple RT tasks required participants to respond to individual stimuli, whereas choice RT tasks required forced-choice responses to two or more stimuli. Interference control tasks required a decision in the context of a distractor or priming stimulus; in an effort to minimize inhibitory demands, we extracted RTs only from baseline and congruent conditions of such tasks. All tasks required nonverbal (motor) responses. The overall effect-size estimate indicated significantly longer mean RTs in ASD groups (g = .35, 95% CI = .16; .54) than comparison groups. Task type moderated effects, with larger estimates drawn from simple RT tasks than interference control tasks. However, across all three task types, ASD groups exhibited significantly longer mean RTs than comparison groups. Stimulus type and age did not moderate effects. Generalized slowing may be a domain-general characteristic of ASD with potential consequences for social, language, and motor development. Assessing processing speed may inform development of interventions to support autistic individuals and their diverse cognitive profiles.","The research was supported by a Doctoral Student Research Grant awarded to N.

Conflicting reports of lymphocyte subpopulation abnormalities have been described in numerous studies of patients with ASD. To better define lymphocytes abnormalities in ASD, we performed a meta-analysis of the lymphocyte profiles from subjects with ASD.MethodsWe used the PRISMA recommendations to query PubMed, Embase, PsychoINFO, BIOSIS, Science Direct, Cochrane CENTRAL, and Clinicaltrials.gov for terms related to clinical diagnosis of ASD and to lymphocytes’ populations. We selected studies exploring lymphocyte subpopulations in children with ASD. The search protocol has been registered in the international Prospective Register of Systematic Reviews (CRD42019121473).ResultsWe selected 13 studies gathering 388 ASD patients and 326 healthy controls. A significant decrease in the CD4+ lymphocyte was found in ASD patients compared to controls [− 1.51 (95% CI − 2.99; − 0.04) p = 0.04] (I2 = 96% [95% CI 94.6, 97.7], p < 0.01). No significant difference was found for the CD8+ T, B and natural killer lymphocytes. Considering the CD4+ subpopulation, there was a significant decrease in regulatory T lymphocytes (Tregs) in ASD patients (n = 114) compared to controls (n = 107) [− 3.09 (95% CI − 4.41; − 1.76) p = 0.0001]; (I2 = 90.9%, [95% CI 76.2, 96.5], p < 0.0001) associated with an increase oin the Th17 lymphocytes (ASD; n = 147 controls; n = 128) [2.23 (95% CI 0.79; 3.66) p = 0,002] (I2 = 95.1% [95% CI 90.4, 97.5], p < 0.0001).LimitationsSeveral factors inducing heterogeneity should be considered. First, differences in the staining method may be responsible for a part in the heterogeneity of results. Second, ASD population is also by itself heterogeneous, underlying the need of studying sub-groups that are more homogeneous.ConclusionOur meta-analysis indicates defects in CD4+ lymphocytes, specifically decrease oin Tregs and increase in Th17 in ASD patients and supports the development of targeted immunotherapies in the field of ASD.","We would like to thank all the authors who have kindly provided additional unpublished information/data: M.

Specifically, use of a profiling model can reveal less visible autistic differences, including strengths and abilities. Binary logistic regressions showed that the likelihood of extreme distress responses could be interpreted based on parent-reported autistic thinking pattern profiles for 140 young people. Perspective-taking (specifically empathy), extreme demand avoidance, and over-sensory sensitivity each contributed to the combined regression models. From the clinical perspective of autism as a multi-dimensional and inter-connected construct, there may be implications for planning support and building positive self-understanding. Individually tailored adjustments and support strategies may be identified more easily after delineating variables found across four core aspects: sensory coherence, flexible thinking, perspective-taking, and regulation.","The authors would like to acknowledge the families who attended the diagnostic assessment service, and to thank Dr Oliver Clark, Dissertation Supervisor, Manchester Metropolitan University; Prof Taj Nathan (Director of Research and Effectiveness), Prof Sujeet Jaydeokar and Dr Matthew Howard (Clinical Directors), Dr Ian Davidson (Consultant Psychiatrist and Royal College of Psychiatrists Autism Champion) and Dr Phil Elliott (Senior Research Facilitator), all at Cheshire and Wirral Partnership NHS Foundation Trust.

Our results indicate that children aged 1.5-5 years with feeding problems may present with elevated internalizing difficulties and alterations in sensory processing when compared to same-age children without feeding problems. Our study also proposes that sensory processing may be an important, mediating factor in the relationship between autism features and feeding problems. The present work suggests, therefore, that implementers should thoroughly consider the sensory profile of autistic children prior to intervening on feeding behaviors. In particular, based on these preliminary findings, feeding interventions could benefit from environments designed to support children who can find them noisy and overwhelming.",The authors are especially grateful to all the families of the children who took part in this study.,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Child; Humans; Autistic Disorder; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Feeding Behavior,05/03/2022,2022,05/03/2022,2022-11,26,8,2165-2174,Closed,Article,"Crippa, Alessandro; Colombo, Paola; De Cosmi, Valentina; Mazzocchi, Alessandra; Scaglioni, Silvia; Spolidoro, Giulia Carla Immacolata; Bettocchi, Silvia; D’Oria, Veronica; Viganò, Nicole; Mani, Elisa; Molteni, Massimo; Agostoni, Carlo","Crippa, Alessandro (IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Italy); Colombo, Paola (IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Italy); De Cosmi, Valentina (University of Milan, Italy); Mazzocchi, Alessandra (Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Italy); Scaglioni, Silvia (Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Italy); Spolidoro, Giulia Carla Immacolata (University of Milan, Italy); Bettocchi, Silvia (Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Italy); D’Oria, Veronica (Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Italy); Viganò, Nicole (IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Italy); Mani, Elisa (IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Italy); Molteni, Massimo (IRCCS Eugenio Medea, Italy); Agostoni, Carlo (University of Milan, Italy; Fondazione IRCCS Ca’ Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico, Italy)","Crippa, Alessandro (IRCCS Eugenio Medea)","Crippa, Alessandro (IRCCS Eugenio Medea); Colombo, Paola (IRCCS Eugenio Medea); De Cosmi, Valentina (University of Milan); Mazzocchi, Alessandra (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico); Scaglioni, Silvia (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico); Spolidoro, Giulia Carla Immacolata (University of Milan); Bettocchi, Silvia (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico); D’Oria, Veronica (Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico); Viganò, Nicole (IRCCS Eugenio Medea); Mani, Elisa (IRCCS Eugenio Medea); Molteni, Massimo (IRCCS Eugenio Medea); Agostoni, Carlo (University of Milan; Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico)",Fondazione IRCCS Ca' Granda Ospedale Maggiore Policlinico; University of Milan; IRCCS Eugenio Medea,grid.414818.0; grid.4708.b; grid.420417.4,Italy; Italy; Italy,Ministero della Salute,1,1,,,13,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146074759,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,No,,,

To address remaining questions about the unexplained heterogeneity between study results and the possibility of risk for specific autism sub-phenotypes, we conducted a whole-population cohort study in Denmark. We followed births 1991-2011 (1,294,906 persons, including 993,301 siblings in 728,271 families), from 1 year of age until an autism diagnosis (13,547), death, emigration, or December 31, 2012. Autism, with and without attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and with and without intellectual disability (ID) were based on ICD-8 and ICD-10 codes from Danish national health registers, including 3,319 autism + ADHD, 10,228 autism - no ADHD, 2,205 autism + ID, and 11,342 autism - no ID. We estimated hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% confidence intervals (95% CIs) between any maternal smoking (from birth records) and autism (or sub-phenotypes) using survival models with robust standard errors, stratifying by birth year and adjusting for child sex, parity, and parental age, education, income, and psychiatric history. To additionally address confounding using family designs, we constructed a maternal cluster model (adjusting for the smoking proportion within the family), and a stratified sibling model. Associations with maternal smoking and autism were elevated in conventional adjusted analyses (HR of 1.17 [1.13-1.22]) but attenuated in the maternal cluster (0.98 [0.88-1.09]) and sibling (0.86 [0.64-1.15]) models. Similarly, risks of autism sub-phenotypes with maternal smoking were attenuated in the family-based models. Together these results support that smoking in pregnancy is not linked with autism or select autism comorbid sub-phenotypes after accounting for familial confounding. Autism Res 2020, 13: 134-144. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Smoking during pregnancy has many harmful impacts, which may include harming the baby's developing brain. However, in a study of thousands of families in Denmark, it does not appear that smoking in pregnancy leads to autism or autism in combination with intellectual problems or attention deficits, once you account for the way smoking patterns and developmental disabilities run in families.",,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Cohort Studies; Denmark; Family; Female; Humans; Male; Mothers; Parents; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Proportional Hazards Models; Risk Factors; Siblings; Smoking; Young Adult,29/08/2019,2019,29/08/2019,2020-01,13,1,134-144,All OA; Green,Article,"Kalkbrenner, Amy E.; Meier, Sandra M.; Madley‐Dowd, Paul; Ladd‐Acosta, Christine; Fallin, Margaret Daniele; Parner, Erik; Schendel, Diana","Kalkbrenner, Amy E.

When the context maintained the world, participants showed appropriate detection of the inconsistent critical word.

One way to support these children is to include them in mainstream schools. However, currently, African children with developmental disabilities are often excluded from mainstream education opportunities. People involved (e.g. teachers, families and children) can offer information on factors that could ease or interfere with inclusion. This article discusses the findings of published studies that explored the views of relevant groups on including children with developmental disabilities in mainstream schools in sub-Saharan Africa. We systematically searched the literature and identified 32 relevant articles from seven countries in sub-Saharan Africa. We found that unclear policies and insufficient training, resources and support for teachers often blocked the implementation of inclusive education. Factors in favour of inclusive education were the commitment of many teachers to include pupils with developmental disabilities and the work of non-governmental organisations (NGOs), which provided resources and training. This review suggests that motivated teachers should be provided with appropriate training, resources and support for inclusive education, directly and by promoting the work of NGOs.",EG expresses her gratitude to Dr Matthew Prina for his helpful advice during the planning stage of this review.,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Africa South of the Sahara; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Mainstreaming, Education; Qualitative Research",30/05/2022,2022,30/05/2022,2022-10,26,7,1606-1625,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Genovesi, Elisa; Jakobsson, Cecilia; Nugent, Lena; Hanlon, Charlotte; Hoekstra, Rosa A","Genovesi, Elisa (King’s College London, UK); Jakobsson, Cecilia (Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust, UK); Nugent, Lena (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf, Germany); Hanlon, Charlotte (King’s College London, UK; Addis Ababa University, Ethiopia); Hoekstra, Rosa A (King’s College London, UK)","Genovesi, Elisa (King's College London)","Genovesi, Elisa (King's College London); Jakobsson, Cecilia (Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust); Nugent, Lena (University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf); Hanlon, Charlotte (King's College London; Addis Ababa University); Hoekstra, Rosa A (King's College London)",Addis Ababa University; University Medical Center Hamburg-Eppendorf; King's College London; Sussex Partnership NHS Foundation Trust,grid.7123.7; grid.13648.38; grid.13097.3c; grid.451317.5,Ethiopia; Germany; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Wellcome Trust; Department of Health and Social Care; Economic and Social Research Council; National Institute for Health Research,0,0,,,6,https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613221096208,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148284576,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,4 Quality Education,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=185486,Systematic Review,

However, the characteristics of white matter connectivity in ASD have remained inconclusive in previous diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) studies. The current meta-analysis aimed to comprehensively elucidate the abnormality in language-related white matter connectivity in individuals with ASD. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, Scopus, and Medline databases to identify relevant studies. The standardized mean difference was calculated to measure the pooled difference in DTI metrics in each tract between the ASD and typically developing (TD) groups. The moderating effects of age, sex, language ability, and symptom severity were investigated using subgroup and meta-regression analysis. Thirty-three DTI studies involving 831 individuals with ASD and 836 TD controls were included in the meta-analysis. ASD subjects showed significantly lower fractional anisotropy or higher mean diffusivity across language-associated tracts than TD controls. These abnormalities tended to be more prominent in the left language networks than in the right. In addition, children with ASD exhibit more pronounced and pervasive disturbances in white matter connectivity than adults. These results support the under-connectivity hypothesis and demonstrate the widespread abnormal microstructure of language-related tracts in patients with ASD. Otherwise, white matter abnormalities in the autistic brain could vary depending on the developmental stage and hemisphere. LAY SUMMARY: This meta-analysis explored abnormalities in white matter connectivity in language networks of individuals with ASD. Significantly reduced white matter integrity was found in all language-associated tracts in subjects with ASD compared with TD controls. In addition, structural disturbances of language networks in the autistic brain exhibit a leftward tendency, and more prominent abnormalities are observed in younger people with ASD than in adults.",The authors thank all of the researchers who participated in the studies involved in the current article.,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806","Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Humans; White Matter",13/08/2022,2022,13/08/2022,2022-09,15,9,1585-1602,All OA; Green,Article,"Li, Min; Wang, Yide; Tachibana, Masaya; Rahman, Shafiur; Kagitani‐Shimono, Kuriko","Li, Min (Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan); Wang, Yide (Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan); Tachibana, Masaya (Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan); Rahman, Shafiur (Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi‐ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan; Research Center for Child Mental Development, Hamamatsu University School of Medicine, Higashi‐ku, Hamamatsu, Shizuoka, Japan); Kagitani‐Shimono, Kuriko (Department of Child Development, United Graduate School of Child Development, Osaka University, Suita, Osaka, Japan)","Kagitani‐Shimono, Kuriko (Osaka University)","Li, Min (Osaka University); Wang, Yide (Osaka University); Tachibana, Masaya (Osaka University); Rahman, Shafiur (Hamamatsu University School of Medicine; Hamamatsu University School of Medicine); Kagitani‐Shimono, Kuriko (Osaka University)",Hamamatsu University School of Medicine; Osaka University,grid.505613.4; grid.136593.b,Japan; Japan,,1,1,,,9,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9546367,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150222803,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=282765,Systematic Review,

Controls were selected from the Finnish Medical Birth Register. Conditional logistic regression models were used for statistical analyses. Advanced paternal age (35–49 years) was associated with childhood autism in offspring, whereas advanced maternal age was associated with both Asperger’s syndrome and PDD in offspring (35 years or more and 40 years or more, respectively). Teenage motherhood (19 years or less) was associated with PDD in offspring. The main finding was that maternal and paternal ages were differentially associated with ASD subtypes.

Statins rescue the social and cognitive phenotype in animal knockout models, but translational trials with subjects > 8 years using cognition/behaviour outcomes have shown mixed results. This trial breaks new ground by studying statin effects for the first time in younger children with NF1 and co-morbid autism and by using multiparametric imaging outcomes.MethodsA single-site triple-blind RCT of simvastatin vs. placebo was done. Assessment (baseline and 12-week endpoint) included peripheral MAPK assay, awake magnetic resonance imaging spectroscopy (MRS; GABA and glutamate+glutamine (Glx)), arterial spin labelling (ASL), apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC), resting state functional MRI, and autism behavioural outcomes (Aberrant Behaviour Checklist and Clinical Global Impression).ResultsThirty subjects had a mean age of 8.1 years (SD 1.8). Simvastatin was well tolerated. The amount of imaging data varied by test. Simvastatin treatment was associated with (i) increased frontal white matter MRS GABA (t(12) = − 2.12, p = .055), GABA/Glx ratio (t(12) = − 2.78, p = .016), and reduced grey nuclei Glx (ANCOVA p < 0.05, Mann-Whitney p < 0.01); (ii) increased ASL perfusion in ventral diencephalon (Mann-Whitney p < 0.01); and (iii) decreased ADC in cingulate gyrus (Mann-Whitney p < 0.01). Machine-learning classification of imaging outcomes achieved 79% (p < .05) accuracy differentiating groups at endpoint against chance level (64%, p = 0.25) at baseline. Three of 12 (25%) simvastatin cases compared to none in placebo met ‘clinical responder’ criteria for behavioural outcome.ConclusionsWe show feasibility of peripheral MAPK assay and autism symptom measurement, but the study was not powered to test effectiveness. Multiparametric imaging suggests possible simvastatin effects in brain areas previously associated with NF1 pathophysiology and the social brain network.Trial registrationEU Clinical Trial Register (EudraCT) 2012-005742-38 (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu)","We gratefully acknowledge the collaboration of Rosemont Pharmaceuticals (https://www.rosemontpharma.com/), who supplied the study drug and placebo formulation.

In this study, strategies were used to reduce use of unsupported practices. First, specially-designed information sheets were shared with teachers about the evidence-base of two practices used in schools: one unsupported (sensory integration therapy [SIT]) and one supported (antecedent-based interventions [ABI]). A professional development program was then implemented to improve knowledge and use of ABI. The information sheets significantly reduced teacher support for SIT, however this was not maintained following professional development. Support for ABI remained unchanged across phases. The need for ongoing teacher professional development in replacing use of unsupported practices with more evidence-based approaches is discussed.","The authors would like to acknowledge the Department of Education Queensland, Education Horizon grant which supported this work.

The procedure was designed by taking into account methodological challenges arising from the acquisition of Resting State fMRI (RS fMRI) data, and factors such as cost, time, and staff availability. The ultimate aim was to prepare an imaging preparation protocol with high transferability to the whole autism spectrum, adaptable for use in a multi-site research with multiple time points. As part of a randomized pharmaco-intervention study, 31 children aged 4-10 years with Neurofibromatosis 1 and autism underwent MR imaging at baseline and end of intervention. The protocol consisted of tailored habituation instructions including gradual exposure to scanner noise, a social stories booklet, positive incentive strategies, and Play Therapy support. Success rate for initial acquisition was 71% for GABA+ MR spectroscopy at either location, 87% for perfusion, and 67% for diffusion assessment, and 71% for RS fMRI. Qualitative data indicated that 84% parents found the habituation protocol helpful. LAY SUMMARY: Here we describe a protocol for brain Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) tailored for children with ASD to help reduce stress and avoid sedation during scanning. This procedure can make advanced medical imaging more accessible and promote a better MRI experience for families of children with ASD.","We gratefully acknowledge the support of Adriana Di Martino and F.

We tested the hypothesis that ASD patients exhibit difficulties in facial emotional recognition via perceptual binding difficulties due to weak coherence. We assessed 18 ASD and 27 typically developing individuals for their ability to identify emotional expressions from faces in pictures moving behind a narrow vertical and horizontal slit. In this task, only a single local piece of facial information was provided at any one time through the slit. Using a voxel-based analysis of neurite-orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI), we examined the relationship between NODDI index values at each voxel and the behavioral performance of ASD patients in the slit-viewing paradigm. ASD patients demonstrated impaired recognition of facial emotional expression only in horizontal slit-viewing. This deficit was associated with deficits in communication ability. Voxel-based analysis revealed significant negative correlations between behavioral deficits in horizontal slit-viewing and NODDI index values in clusters including the ventral occipital complex region, superior temporal/parietal association areas, and forceps major of the corpus callosum. Our results indicated deficits for the first time in perceptual integration of facial expression across hemispheres in ASD patients due to microstructural disturbances in the corpus callosum and areas related to viewing of the human face. This may underscore the difficulties faced by ASD patients in understanding the emotions of other people, contributing to impairments in communication ability in ASD patients.

LAY SUMMARY: We assessed ASD and typically developing individuals for their ability to identify emotional expressions from faces in pictures moving behind a narrow vertical and horizontal slit. ASD patients demonstrated impaired recognition of facial emotional expression only in horizontal slit-viewing. Voxel-based analysis revealed significant negative correlations between behavioral deficits and NODDI index values in clusters including the corpus callosum. Our results indicated deficits in perceptual integration of facial expression across hemispheres in ASD patients potentially resulting from microstructural disturbances.",We would like to thank the staff of the MRI facility at the Department of Radiology of Nara Medical University for subject care and data acquisition.

Therefore, this meta-analysis investigated placebo response in core symptoms.MethodsWe searched ClinicalTrials.gov, CENTRAL, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, WHO-ICTRP (up to July 8, 2018), and PubMed (up to July 4, 2019) for randomized pharmacological and dietary supplement placebo-controlled trials (RCTs) with a minimum of seven days of treatment. Single-group meta-analyses were conducted using a random-effects model. Standardized mean changes (SMC) of core symptoms in placebo arms were the primary outcomes and placebo positive response rates were a secondary outcome. Predictors of placebo response were investigated with meta-regression analyses. The protocol was registered with PROSPERO ID CRD42019125317.ResultsEighty-six RCTs with 2360 participants on placebo were included in our analysis (87% in children/adolescents). The majority of trials were small, single-center with a duration of 8–12 weeks and published after 2009. Placebo response in social-communication difficulties was SMC = − 0.32, 95% CI [− 0.39, − 0.25], in repetitive behaviors − 0.23[− 0.32, − 0.15] and in scales measuring overall core symptoms − 0.36 [− 0.46, − 0.26]. Overall, 19%, 95% CI [16–22%] of participants were at least much improved with placebo. Caregiver (vs. clinician) ratings, lower risk of bias, flexible-dosing, larger sample sizes and number of sites, less recent publication year, baseline levels of irritability, and the use of a threshold of core symptoms at inclusion were associated with larger placebo response in at least a core symptom domain.LimitationsAbout 40% of the trials had an apparent focus on core symptoms. Investigation of the differential impact of predictors on placebo and drug response was impeded by the use of diverse experimental interventions with essentially different mechanisms of action. An individual-participant-data meta-analysis could allow for a more fine-grained analysis and provide more informative answers.ConclusionsPlacebo response in ASD was substantial and predicted by design- and participant-related factors, which could inform the design of future trials in order to improve the detection of efficacy in core symptoms. Potential solutions could be the minimization and careful selection of study sites as well as rigorous participant enrollment and the use of measurements of change not solely dependent on caregivers.","We would like to thank Farhad Sokraneh, information specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, who conducted the first search in electronic databases, Dr. Yikang Zhu for the translation of a Chinese study and Prof. Toshi Furukawa for the translation of a Japanese study.

This study used mixed-methods (84 case-registers and 20 in-depth interviews with caregivers of children with a diagnosis of autism) to explore the extent to which the nature of parental concerns and prior knowledge of developmental disorders impact the time between symptom recognition and autism diagnosis, and the contextual family, societal and health-system related factors that impede the autism help-seeking pathway. Lack of awareness of age-appropriate child developmental milestones, apparent amongst the community and health professionals, contributed to a 1.5-year delay between parental concerns and autism diagnosis. Recommendations to shorten this help-seeking pathway include harnessing the potential of non-specialist workers to increase awareness and enable developmental monitoring of young children through scalable tools.","The authors would like to thank Neha Verma, Mahima Pandey, Saani Sakeel, Pooja Burman, Gitanjali Lal and Divya Chaudhary for their assistance with data collection.

Joint attention, symbolic play, engagement and regulation intervention (JASPER) is a well-researched naturalistic developmental behavioural intervention but, to date, no reviews have specifically evaluated its effects. This systematic literature review examined the effects of JASPER intervention and its components on child, parent and educator outcomes. Of the 96 articles screened, 19 were eligible for inclusion in the review. Most studies found that children who received JASPER intervention showed significantly greater improvements in at least one outcome related to child joint attention, joint engagement, play skills and language skills compared to the comparison group. Implementation outcomes for parents and educators were generally positive. There were no consistent predictors or mediators of treatment effects. None of the studies met all of the quality indicators outlined by the Council of Exceptional Children, and the majority of outcome measures were classified as proximal. Overall, JASPER intervention appears promising in improving child outcomes directly targeted during treatment. More research is needed to determine whether it is also effective in improving a wider range of outcomes for children with autism spectrum disorder.Lay abstractInterventions which are delivered in natural contexts and use both developmental and behavioural techniques may be helpful for children with, or suspected of having, autism spectrum disorder.

61,2648,pub.1137703762,10.1002/aur.2526,33938641,,,A granular perspective on inclusion: Objectively measured interactions of preschoolers with and without autism,"Children's preschool experiences have consequences for development. However, it is not clear how children's real-time interactions with peers affect their language development; nor is it clear whether these processes differ between children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and two other groups of children, those with general developmental delays (DD) and typically developing (TD) children. We used objective measures of movement and vocalizations to quantify children's real-time dyadic vocal interactions and quantify classroom social networks. Participants included 56 preschoolers (22 female; M = 50.14 months) in five inclusive classrooms for children with ASD or DD and their TD peers. Each class was observed monthly on two to five occasions. Overall, children vocalized more to peers who had vocalized more to them in the previous observation. These dyadic vocalization patterns were associated with group differences in social network analyses. Modularity, the cohesiveness of group ties, was lower among children with ASD than it was among TD children or children with DD. Individually, children with ASD exhibited lower total levels of vocalizations with peers (lower degree centrality) than TD children and children with DD. In an exploratory analysis with a subset of the participants, children's degree centrality was strongly associated with their end-of-year assessed language abilities, even when accounting for mean differences between groups. Findings highlight the impact peers and social networks play in real-time language use and in the developing language abilities of children with ASD in inclusion classrooms. LAY SUMMARY: This study objectively measured associations between children's peer vocal interactions and assessed language abilities in inclusion classrooms for children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and their peers. All children benefited from peers talking to them, but children with ASD were less central to classroom speech networks than were typically developing children. Children's centrality to social speech networks, regardless of ASD status, was associated with assessed language abilities.","This research was funded by a grant from the Institute for Educational Sciences #R324A180203 awarded to D.S.M.

There is some evidence that autistic children have problems with how they perceive and understand time. However, little is currently known about this, or the ways in which behaviours related to time are impacted in daily life. In this study, 113 parents of autistic children and 201 parents of neurotypical children completed a questionnaire and open-ended questions about their child's behaviour relating to time. Questionnaire scores were lower in the autistic group compared with neurotypicals, which suggests that behaviours relating to time are affected in autistic children. The open-ended responses further confirmed that the autistic children struggled with time and that this impacted on them and their family. Three key themes were identified. Theme 1: autistic children have problems with learning about concepts relating to time such as telling the time from a clock and using words to describe time (hours, minutes, etc.) appropriately. Theme 2: autistic children think about the future differently. Planning and working under time pressure were described as a problem. Theme 3: autistic children have strong interests which take up a lot of their attention and worrying about having sufficient time to pursue these interests causes anxiety. This research indicates that behaviours related to time can have a considerable impact on the lives of autistic children and that targeted support may be required.",The authors thank all of the families who volunteered for this study.

TSC is strongly associated with broad neurodevelopmental disorders, including autism spectrum disorder symptomatology. Preclinical TSC studies have indicated altered neuronal chloride homeostasis affecting the polarity of γ-aminobutyric acid (GABA) ergic transmission as a potential treatment target. Bumetanide, a selective NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist, may attenuate depolarizing GABA action, and in that way reduce disease burden. In this open-label pilot study, we tested the effect of bumetanide on a variety of neurophysiological, cognitive, and behavioral measures in children with TSC.MethodsParticipants were treated with bumetanide (2dd 0.5–1.0 mg) for 13 weeks in an open-label trial. The Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Irritability (ABC-I) subscale was chosen as the primary endpoint. Secondary endpoints included other behavioral questionnaires in addition to event-related potentials (ERP) and neuropsychological tests if tolerated. Additionally, the treatment effect on seizure frequency and quality of life was assessed. Endpoint data were collected at baseline, after 91 days of treatment and after a 28-day wash-out period.ResultsFifteen patients (8–21-years old) with TSC were included of which 13 patients completed the study. Treatment was well-tolerated with only expected adverse events due to the diuretic effects of bumetanide. Irritable behavior (ABC-I) showed significant improvement after treatment in 11 out of 13 patients (t(12) = 4.41, p = .001, d = .773). A favorable effect was also found for social behavior (Social Responsiveness Scale) (t(11) = 4.01, p = .002, d = .549) and hyperactive behavior (ABC-hyperactivity subscale) (t(12) = 3.65, p = .003, d = .686). Moreover, patients rated their own health-related quality of life higher after treatment. At baseline, TSC patients showed several atypical ERPs versus typically developing peers of which prepulse inhibition was significantly decreased in the TSC group. Neuropsychological measurements showed no change and bumetanide had no effect on seizure frequency.LimitationsThe sample size and open-label design of this pilot study warrant caution when interpreting outcome measures.ConclusionsBumetanide treatment is a potential treatment to alleviate the behavioral burden and quality of life associated with TSC. More elaborate trials are needed to determine the application and effect size of bumetanide for the TSC population.Trial registrationEU Clinical Trial Register, EudraCT 2016-002408-13 (www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2016-002408-13/NL).

A systematic review,"This review systematically synthesized evidence on the association between structural language ability and behaviors of concern (BoC) in autism. Four databases were searched for studies that included >10 autistic participants, measures of structural language (content and/or form of language) and BoC, and an analysis of their association. BoCs included self-injurious behavior (SIB), aggression, tantrums, and externalizing behavior. Methodological quality of studies were assessed using the Newcastle Ottawa Scale. Forty-five publications (n = 11,961) were included. Forty studies were cross-sectional and five were prospective cohort studies. Over 70% of the studies investigating expressive language and SIB (n = 10), aggression (n = 5), tantrums (n = 3), and externalizing behavior (n = 17) reported an inverse association, where lower expressive language ability was associated with increased BoC. Eleven out of sixteen studies of combined expressive and receptive language reported an inverse relationship with SIB or aggression. All outcomes were rated as moderate to very low certainty of evidence. This review highlights evidence showing an inverse association between expressive or combined language ability and SIB, and externalizing behavior in autism. However, further high-quality studies that use standardized, consistent measures of language and behavior and investigate longitudinal associations are needed. Early detection and support for reduced structural language difficulties have substantial potential to assist in reducing BoC.","We would like to acknowledge Rui Wang for statistical advice, and Charlotte Kimpton who assisted with screening some articles.

However, it is unclear what tools are currently being used to assess depression in ASC, or whether tools need to be adapted for this group. This systematic review therefore aimed to identify tools used to assess depression in adults with and without ASC, and then evaluate these tools for their appropriateness and measurement properties. Medline, PsychINFO and Web of Knowledge were searched for studies of depression in: (a) adults with ASC, without co-morbid intellectual disability; and (b) adults from the general population without co-morbid conditions. Articles examining the measurement properties of these tools were then searched for using a methodological filter in PubMed, and the quality of the evidence was evaluated using the COSMIN checklist. Twelve articles were identified which utilized three tools to assess depression in adults with ASC, but only one article which assessed the measurement properties of one of these tools was identified and thus evaluated. Sixty-four articles were identified which utilized five tools to assess depression in general population adults, and fourteen articles had assessed the measurement properties of these tools. Overall, two tools were found to be robust in their measurement properties in the general population-the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI-II), and the patient health questionnaire (PHQ-9). Crucially only one study was identified from the COSMIN search, which showed weak evidence in support of the measurement properties of the BDI-II in an ASC sample. Implications for effective measurement of depression in ASC are discussed.

LAY SUMMARY: Depression is the most common mental health problem experienced by adults with autism. However, the current study found very limited evidence regarding how useful tools developed for the general population are for adults with autism.

Fifteen autistic participants and a matched control group of 18 typically-developed (TD) volunteers completed a Remember-Know paradigm manipulated by encoding-type (categorical, perceptual) and item-typicality (high-typical, low-typical). The autistic group showed worse and slower recognition and less recollection but equivalent familiarity-based memories compared to TDs. Notably, low-typical items did not improve their memories as they did for TDs, likely due to difficulties in matching low-fit information to the stored schema. Results suggest that memory decline in ASD may derive from the episodic system and its dynamics with the semantic system. These findings may inform interventional strategies for enhancing learning abilities in ASD.","The authors would like to thank all the feedback from colleagues and experts who helped improve this work, the cooperation of the institutions that mediated the access to the clinical sample, and the participants for their valuable contribution to the present research.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",,26/05/2022,2022,26/05/2022,26/05/2022,,,01-Nov,Closed,Article,"Souza, Cristiane; Garrido, Margarida V.; Horchak, Oleksandr V.; Barahona-Correa, J.

Several previous studies have identified preterm birth as a risk factor for ASD but none has studied whether the association between gestational age and ASD has changed over time. This is a Danish population-based follow-up study including live-born singletons born in Denmark between 1980 and 2009, identified in the Danish Medical Birth Registry, a study population of 1,775,397 children. We used a Cox regression model combined with spline to study the risk for ASD by gestational age across three decades of birth cohorts. We included 19,020 children diagnosed with ASD. Across all birth year cohorts, we found that the risk of being diagnosed with ASD increased with lower gestational age (P-value: <0.01). Across all gestational weeks, we found a statistically significant higher risk estimates in birth cohort 1980 to 1989, compared to birth cohorts 1990 to 1999 and 2000 to 2009, respectively. No statistically significant difference in risk estimates was observed between birth cohort 1990 to 1999 and 2000 to 2009. The observed time trend in risk of ASD after preterm birth may reflect: (1) a change in the risk profile of persons with ASD due to the broadening of ASD diagnostic criteria over time; or (2) improved neonatal care for low GA infants, which has reduced risk of adverse outcomes like ASD in preterm children.","Funding was provided by the Aarhus University Research Foundation, and the Aase and Ejnar Danielsens Foundation.

Such interventions have potential to improve a number of child and parental well-being outcomes beyond disruptive child behavior. This systematic review and meta-analysis assesses evidence for the efficacy of behavioral parent interventions for disruptive and hyperactive child behavior in autism spectrum disorders, as well as parenting efficacy and stress. A total of 11 articles from nine randomized controlled trials were included. Sufficient data were available to calculate standardized mean difference and show favorable effects of behavioral parent interventions on parent-reported measures of child disruptive behavior (standardized mean difference = 0.67), hyperactivity (standardized mean difference = 0.31) and parent stress (standardized mean difference = 0.37); effects on parent efficacy are less clear (standardized mean difference = 0.39, p = 0.17). There were insufficient data to explore intervention effects on internalizing behavior in autism spectrum disorders, parenting behaviors, or observational and teacher-reported outcomes, providing important avenues for future research. This review adds to growing evidence of the efficacy of behavioral parent interventions for child behavior and parental well-being in autism spectrum disorders (Prospero: CRD42016033979).","The views expressed in this presentation are those of the authors and not necessarily those of the NHS, the NIHR or the Department of Health and Social Care.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Behavior Therapy; Child; Child Behavior Disorders; Humans; Parenting; Parents; Problem Behavior; Stress, Psychological; Treatment Outcome",28/02/2019,2019,28/02/2019,2019-10,23,7,1630-1644,All OA; Green,Article,"Tarver, Joanne; Palmer, Melanie; Webb, Sophie; Scott, Stephen; Slonims, Vicky; Simonoff, Emily; Charman, Tony","Tarver, Joanne (Aston University, UK; King’s College London, UK); Palmer, Melanie (King’s College London, UK); Webb, Sophie (King’s College London, UK); Scott, Stephen (King’s College London, UK); Slonims, Vicky (Guy’s and St Thomas’ NHS Foundation Trust, UK); Simonoff, Emily (King’s College London, UK); Charman, Tony (King’s College London, UK)","Tarver, Joanne (Aston University; King's College London)","Tarver, Joanne (Aston University; King's College London); Palmer, Melanie (King's College London); Webb, Sophie (King's College London); Scott, Stephen (King's College London); Slonims, Vicky (Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust); Simonoff, Emily (King's College London); Charman, Tony (King's College London)",Aston University; King's College London; Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust,grid.7273.1; grid.13097.3c; grid.420545.2,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Department of Health and Social Care; National Institute for Health Research,58,39,3.59,22.07,1,https://publications.aston.ac.uk/id/eprint/38248/1/PTreviewmanuscript_final_accepted_AutismREVISED.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1112476604,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=33979,Systematic Review,

While there are multiple cortical morphological measures, including cortical thickness, surface area, cortical volume, and cortical gyrification, few single studies have examined all these measures. The current study analyzed all of the four measures and focused on pre-adolescent children with ASD.MethodsWe employed the FreeSurfer pipeline to examine surface-based morphometry in 60 high-functioning boys with ASD (mean age = 8.35 years, range = 4–12 years) and 41 gender-, age-, and IQ-matched typically developing (TD) peers (mean age = 8.83 years), while testing for age-by-diagnosis interaction and between-group differences.ResultsDuring childhood and in specific regions, ASD participants exhibited a lack of normative age-related cortical thinning and volumetric reduction and an abnormal age-related increase in gyrification. Regarding surface area, ASD and TD exhibited statistically comparable age-related development during childhood. Across childhood, ASD relative to TD participants tended to have higher mean levels of gyrification in specific regions. Within ASD, those with higher Social Responsiveness Scale total raw scores tended to have greater age-related increase in gyrification in specific regions during childhood.ConclusionsASD is characterized by cortical neuroanatomical abnormalities that are age-, measure-, statistical model-, and region-dependent. The current study is the first to examine the development of all four cortical measures in one of the largest pre-adolescent samples. Strikingly, Neurosynth-based quantitative reverse inference of the surviving clusters suggests that many of the regions identified above are related to social perception, language, self-referential, and action observation networks—those frequently found to be functionally altered in individuals with ASD. The comprehensive, multilevel analyses across a wide range of cortical measures help fill a knowledge gap and present a complex but rich picture of neuroanatomical developmental differences in children with ASD.","We thank the children and their families for their participation, making this research possible.

Here, we investigate individual differences in cortical organisation related to autistic-like traits. Connectome gradient decomposition based on resting state fMRI data reliably reveals a principal gradient spanning from unimodal to transmodal regions, reflecting the transition from perception to abstract cognition. In our non-clinical sample, this gradient's expansion, indicating less integration between visual and default mode networks, correlates with subjective sensory sensitivity (measured using the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire, GSQ), but not other autistic-like traits (measured using the Autism Spectrum Quotient, AQ). This novel brain-based correlate of the GSQ demonstrates sensory issues can be disentangled from the wider autistic-like phenotype.","We would like to thank Mengze Li for her instrumental role in the collaboration between the University of Sussex and Southwest University, facilitating data access and granting her support during pre-processing of the fMRI data.

Pre-pandemic, clinicians had voiced many TMH concerns, but these had not been investigated with respect to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) even with it being known that there are distinct ASD-associated challenges for in-person mental health interventions.
Method: A convenience sample of (n = 55) clinicians completed an online survey regarding their perspectives of adopting TMH interventions in ASD, with closed- and open-answered questions. Quantitative and qualitative data were analysed descriptively/inferentially and via Content Analysis, respectively.
Results: Multiple clinicians endorsed each TMH challenges/barrier previously identified as concerns in the non-ASD literature. However, overall levels of concern over challenges/barriers were low, and challenges were more likely to be predicted than experienced and considered to be case/presentation specific. Challenges that were considered ASD-specific included the exacerbation of those associated with in-person delivery in ASD, alongside difficulties with trust and appropriate remote social behaviour. On average, clinicians indicated a preference for 50% TMH interventions post-pandemic. Clinicians' perceived technological competence and extent of professional experience with ASD were not significantly associated with levels of concern, nor number of experienced challenges, with TMH interventions in ASD.
Conclusion: In support of the existing TMH literature, challenges/barriers were more likely to be predicted than experienced and were considered to be case/presentation-specific, though this may be more variable in ASD owing to the well-established marked heterogeneity in this population. Remote provision of interventions exacerbated in-person ASD-associated challenges, as predicted, but clinician-level factors appeared not to impact TMH perceptions.","The authors would like to acknowledge the clinicians who participated and helped to distribute the survey, members of the networks that helped to distribute the survey, and the funding bodies that provided financial support.

In the present longitudinal study, college roommates with minimal familiarity prior to cohabitation (N = 162) completed the broad autism phenotype questionnaire and intermittently reported on their relationship quality and interpersonal behaviors toward their roommate over their first 10 weeks of living together. Actor-Partner Interdependence Models demonstrated that roommates mismatched on aloofness (one high and one low) had lower relationship satisfaction than those matched on it, with the interpersonal behavior of warmth mediating this association. Because relationship satisfaction remained high when both roommates were aloof, satisfaction does not appear predicated upon the presence of aloofness generally but rather reflects a product of dissimilarity in aloof profiles between roommates. In contrast, although participants reported less relationship satisfaction and commitment with roommates higher on pragmatic language abnormalities, mismatches on this broad autism phenotype trait, and on rigid personality, were less consequential. In sum, these findings suggest that complementary profiles of social motivation may facilitate relationship quality during the early course of relationship development.","The authors wish to thank M.

To test this, we examined autistic visuomotor control during a virtual racquetball task, in which participants hit normal and unexpectedly-bouncy balls using a handheld controller. The probability of facing each type of ball was varied unpredictably over time. However, during cued trials, participants received explicit information about the likelihood of facing each uncertain outcome. When compared to neurotypical controls, autistic individuals displayed poorer task performance, atypical gaze profiles, and more restricted swing kinematics. These visuomotor patterns were not significantly affected by contextual cues, indicating that autistic people exhibit underlying differences in how prior information and environmental uncertainty are dynamically modulated during movement tasks.",The authors would like to thank all of the participants who took part in this study.

The study group consisted of two representative samples; 47 Gothenburg sibling pairs with mixed ethnicities and 11 Stockholm sibling pairs with Somali background. 25(OH)D levels were analysed in the stored dried blood spots taken in the neonatal period for metabolic screening.ResultsThe collapsed group of children with ASD had significantly lower vitamin D levels (M = 24.0 nM, SD = 19.6) as compared with their siblings (M = 31.9 nM, SD = 27.7), according to a paired samples t-test (P = 0.013). The difference was - most likely - not only accounted for by a difference in season of birth between ASD and non-ASD siblings since the mean 25(OH)D levels differed with similar effect size between the sibling pairs born during winter and summer, respectively. All children with African/Middle East background, both the children with ASD and their non-ASD siblings, had vitamin D deficiency.ConclusionsThe findings suggest that low prenatal vitamin D may act as a risk factor for ASD, however, there is a need for replication with larger samples. Future research should study whether or not adequate supplementation of vitamin D to pregnant women might lower the risk for ASD in the offspring.","We are grateful to associate professor Ulrika von Döbeln and PhD Lene Sörensen at the Center for Inherited Metabolic Diseases at Karolinska University Hospital in Stockholm for invaluable help to get access to the dried blood spots.

Compared to verbally fluent participants, those with language impairments had lower frequencies of almost all psychiatric disorders. Female sex and older age were associated with higher medical and psychiatric morbidity.","The authors express their thanks to the SPARK team at the Simons Foundation, and to the OHSU SPARK team colleagues.

A renewed interest in intrapersonal cognition has recently emerged suggesting a putative dissociation between impaired declarative processes, such as autobiographical memory, and spared implicit processes, such as the sense of agency (SoA) in ASDs. However, so far only a few studies have investigated the integrity of SoA using tasks exclusively tapping reflective mechanisms. Since pre-reflective processes of SoA are based on the same predictive internal models that are involved in planning and monitoring actions, we hypothesized that pre-reflective aspects of SoA, as measured by the intentional binding effect, would be altered in adults with high functioning autism spectrum disorders, relative to volunteers with typical development. Here, in accordance with our hypothesis, we report reduced IB in participants with ASDs.","We gratefully acknowledge the commitment of the participants and their families to the pursuit of research in autism.

Furthermore, duplications in the 15q region are often associated with autism. Both maternal and paternal interstitial 15q11-13 duplication mouse models have been previously created, where several behavioral differences were found in the paternal duplication (patDp/+) mouse but not in the maternal duplication (matDp/+). These included decreased sociability, behavioral inflexibility, abnormal ultrasonic vocalizations, decreased spontaneous activity, and increased anxiety. Similarly, in the current study, we found several anatomical differences in the patDp/+ mice that were not seen in the matDp/+ mice. Regional differences that are evident only in the paternal duplication are a smaller dentate gyrus and smaller medial striatum. These differences may be responsible for the behavioral inflexibility. Furthermore, a smaller dorsal raphe nucleus could be responsible for the reported serotonin defects. This study highlights consistency that can be found between behavioral and anatomical phenotyping.","This work was supported by Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology in Japan Grants‐in‐Aid for Scientific Research (T.T.), CREST from the Japanese Science and Technology Agency (T.T.), the Canadian Institute for Health Research (CIHR), and the Ontario Brain Institute (OBI).",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806","Animals; Autistic Disorder; Brain; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 15; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Mice; Phenotype",07/03/2015,2015,07/03/2015,2015-10,8,5,545-555,Closed,Article,"Ellegood, Jacob; Nakai, Nobuhiro; Nakatani, Jin; Henkelman, Mark; Takumi, Toru; Lerch, Jason","Ellegood, Jacob (Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario Canada (J.E., R.M.H., J.L.).); Nakai, Nobuhiro (RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako, Saiama, Japan (N.N., T.T.).); Nakatani, Jin (Shiga University of Medical Science, Ohtsu, Shiga, Japan (J.N.).); Henkelman, Mark (Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario Canada (J.E., R.M.H., J.L.).; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (R.M.H., J.L.).); Takumi, Toru (RIKEN Brain Science Institute, Wako, Saiama, Japan (N.N., T.T.).; JST, CREST(T.T.).); Lerch, Jason (Mouse Imaging Centre, Hospital for Sick Children, Toronto, Ontario Canada (J.E., R.M.H., J.L.).; Department of Medical Biophysics, University of Toronto, Toronto, Ontario, Canada (R.M.H., J.L.).)","Ellegood, Jacob (Hospital for Sick Children)","Ellegood, Jacob (Hospital for Sick Children); Nakai, Nobuhiro (RIKEN Center for Brain Science); Nakatani, Jin (Shiga University of Medical Science); Henkelman, Mark (Hospital for Sick Children; University of Toronto); Takumi, Toru (RIKEN Center for Brain Science); Lerch, Jason (Hospital for Sick Children; University of Toronto)",Shiga University of Medical Science; University of Toronto; RIKEN Center for Brain Science; Hospital for Sick Children,grid.410827.8; grid.17063.33; grid.474690.8; grid.42327.30,Japan; Canada; Japan; Canada,Ontario Brain Institute; Japan Science and Technology Agency; Canadian Institutes of Health Research; Japan Society for the Promotion of Science,26,5,0.91,3.79,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1052801920,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,

White matter differences in ASC have been widely studied with diffusion imaging but results are heterogeneous and vary across the age range of study participants and varying methodological approaches. To characterize the neurodevelopmental trajectory of white matter maturation, it is necessary to examine a broad age range of individuals on the autism spectrum and typically developing controls, and investigate age × group interactions.MethodsHere, we employed a spatially unbiased tract-based spatial statistics (TBSS) approach to examine age-related differences in white matter connectivity in a sample of 41 individuals with ASC, and 41 matched controls between 7–17 years of age.ResultsWe found significant age-related differences between the ASC and control group in widespread brain regions. This included age-related differences in the uncinate fasciculus, corticospinal tract, inferior longitudinal fasciculus, inferior fronto-occipital fasciculus, anterior thalamic radiation, superior longitudinal fasciculus and forceps major. Measures of fractional anisotropy (FA) were significantly positively associated with age in both groups. However, this relationship was significantly stronger in the ASC group relative to controls. Measures of radial diffusivity (RD) were significantly negatively associated with age in both groups, but this relationship was significantly stronger in the ASC group relative to controls.LimitationsThe generalisability of our findings is limited by the restriction of the sample to right-handed males with an IQ > 70. Furthermore, a longitudinal design would be required to fully investigate maturational processes across this age group.ConclusionsTaken together, our findings suggest that autistic males have an altered trajectory of white matter maturation relative to controls. Future longitudinal analyses are required to further characterize the extent and time course of these differences.","The research leading to these results has received support from (1) the Medical Research Council (MRC, UK) G0800298 awarded to Doctor Sean CL Deoni, (2) the Medical Research Council (MRC, UK) G0400061 awarded to Professor Declan Murphy, (3) the Dr. Mortimer and Theresa Sackler Foundation, (4) the MRC AIMS Consortium, a collaboration of autism research centres in the UK including the Institute of Psychiatry, London, The Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge and the Autism Research Group, University of Oxford.

An aspect of metacognition associated with broader functional abilities in several clinical conditions, but previously unexamined in autism, is self-assessment (i.e., the ability to accurately self-evaluate one’s own performance). We compared self-assessment between 37 autistic adults without intellectual disability to 39 non-autistic (NA) controls on a series of three general cognitive and three social cognitive tasks. Whereas autistic adults and NA adults did not differ in their self-assessment accuracy on general cognitive tasks, they did on social cognitive tasks, with autistic adults demonstrating lower accuracy. The direction of their inaccuracy was variable (i.e., both over and underestimation), and self-assessment was largely unrelated to their level of social functioning. Over versus underestimation may have different functional implications, and warrants future investigation.","This study was supported by internal funds awarded to the senior author.

Thematic analysis identified five themes: core ASD features, co-morbid conditions, transition, disclosure, and services and support. Most students felt educationally but not socially supported; most families felt support was poor in both areas. Transition from secondary school was often unplanned, and disclosure of diagnosis usually occurred after enrolment, often following a significant problem.

Univariate and multivariate linear regression analysis (adjusted for child’s sex, ability to verbalize, categorical IQ score, and fetal growth rate) demonstrated significantly higher SCQ and SRS scores for ASD children of both preterm (<37 weeks) and post-term (>42 weeks) gestational age (GA) compared to ASD children of normal GA, thus indicating that both preterm and post-term children manifest increased ASD symptomatology.

Therefore, it is plausible that autistic individuals do not have a 'deficit' in angry expression recognition, but rather their internal representation of these expressions is characterised by very high-speed movement. In this study, matched groups of autistic and non-autistic adults completed a novel emotion-based task which employed dynamic displays of happy, angry and sad point light facial (PLF) expressions. On each trial, participants moved a slider to manipulate the speed of a PLF stimulus until it moved at a speed that, in their 'mind's eye', was typical of happy, angry or sad expressions. Participants were shown three different types of PLFs-those showing the full-face, only the eye region, and only the mouth region, wherein the latter two were included to test whether differences in facial information sampling underpinned any dissimilarities in speed attributions. Across both groups, participants attributed the highest speeds to angry, then happy, then sad, facial motion. Participants increased the speed of angry and happy expressions by 41% and 27% respectively and decreased the speed of sad expressions by 18%. This suggests that participants have 'caricatured' internal representations of emotion, wherein emotion-related kinematic cues are over-emphasised. There were no differences between autistic and non-autistic individuals in the speeds attributed to full-face and partial-face angry, happy and sad expressions respectively. Consequently, we find no evidence that autistic adults possess atypically fast internal representations of anger.","C. T.

In this population-based cohort study, we examined the familial risk and heritability of ASD with and without co-occurring intellectual disability (ID). We estimated odds ratios and heritability of ASD with ID (ASD+ID) and ASD without ID (ASD-ID) using register-based diagnosis data of 567,436 index persons born in 1984-2009 in Stockholm County, Sweden, and their parents, siblings, cousins, aunts, and uncles. The familial risk profile exhibited differences between ASD-ID and ASD+ID, most notably for index persons with affected parents. For example, for an index person who had at least one parent with ASD, the child's odds of ASD-ID and ASD+ID (95% confidence interval (CI)) increased by 16.2 (14.2-18.6) and 7.4 (5.5-10.0) folds, respectively. The more closely related a family member with ASD was, the greater the observed risk was of ASD in the index person, especially for ASD-ID. The broad-sense heritability (95% CI) for ASD - ID and ASD+ID were 64.6% (46.0-100.0%) and 33.4% (14.4-58.4%), respectively. Familial risk and heritability of ASD may vary by intellectual ability, which implies that risk factors between these ASD phenotypes may differ. Our findings from the heritability analysis and familial risk analysis suggest that ASD-ID may have a greater genetic basis than ASD+ID, although this should be verified in future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is highly heritable, yet how its familial risk and heritability may vary by cognitive ability is not well-understood. In a population-based cohort study on families of 567,436 index persons using Swedish registers data, we found that the familial risk profile differed between ASD with and without intellectual disability.

Clarifying this issue is critical for guiding clinical diagnosis and targeted intervention. The primary objective of the present meta-analysis was to study the characteristics of executive function (EF) in adults with HFA compared to typically developing (TD) adults, by taking five key components into consideration, including inhibition, working memory, flexibility, planning, and fluency. The PubMed and Embase databases were searched to identify peer-reviewed studies that compared EF in adults with and without HFA from 1980 to November 2018. Hedges' g effect sizes were computed to measure the primary outcome. Moderators like age, sex, and diagnostic tools were controlled using meta-regressions. Forty-two studies satisfying the selection criteria were included, which resulted in a large sample size of 2419 participants. A moderate overall effect size for reduced EF across domains was found in adults with HFA, compared with TD (g = 0.57, 95% confidence interval 0.47-0.66). Subsequently, a broad executive dysfunction was found in adults with HFA in this study (flexibility [g = 0.69], planning [g = 0.64], inhibition [g = 0.61], working memory [g = 0.48], fluency [g = 0.42]), with the predominated impairment on flexibility and planning. Taken together, these results provide evidence for the executive dysfunction hypothesis and may assist in the clinical diagnosis and targeted intervention, suggesting the necessity of sustained intervention on EF for individuals with HFA from childhood to adulthood. LAY SUMMARY: The meta-analysis explored the characteristics of EF in adults with high-functioning autism (HFA) comparing to typically developing controls. Moderate effect sizes for reduced EF across domains were found in adults with HFA, with the flexibility and planning being the most predominately impaired. A comprehensive measurement of EF in adults with HFA has important clinical implications for the diagnosis, treatment, prognosis, and a fundamental understanding for developmental trajectory of these patients.","This work was supported by grant from Beijing Municipal Science and Technology Commission (Z181100001518005), Simons Foundation Grant (No. 274177).",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806","Adult; Autistic Disorder; Executive Function; Humans; Inhibition, Psychological; Memory, Short-Term",16/04/2020,2020,16/04/2020,2020-12,13,12,2102-2121,Closed,Article,"Xie, Rao; Sun, Xiao; Yang, Li; Guo, Yanqing","Xie, Rao (Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Centre for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), NHC Key Laboratory of Mental Health, (Peking University), Beijing, China); Sun, Xiao (Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Centre for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), NHC Key Laboratory of Mental Health, (Peking University), Beijing, China); Yang, Li (Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Centre for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), NHC Key Laboratory of Mental Health, (Peking University), Beijing, China); Guo, Yanqing (Peking University Sixth Hospital (Institute of Mental Health), National Clinical Research Centre for Mental Disorders (Peking University Sixth Hospital), NHC Key Laboratory of Mental Health, (Peking University), Beijing, China)","Yang, Li (Peking University Sixth Hospital); Guo, Yanqing (Peking University Sixth Hospital)","Xie, Rao (Peking University Sixth Hospital); Sun, Xiao (Peking University Sixth Hospital); Yang, Li (Peking University Sixth Hospital); Guo, Yanqing (Peking University Sixth Hospital)",Peking University Sixth Hospital,grid.459847.3,China,Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commision; Simons Foundation,7,6,0.58,2.73,11,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1126698922,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=115786,Systematic Review,

In the present study, we describe the housing situation of a large sample of adults with autism and mostly (above) average intellectual abilities (n = 1429; 17 to 84 years), and examine predictors of independent living, accommodation satisfaction, neighborhood satisfaction, and satisfaction with life based on an online survey. The outcomes of independently living adults were compared with those from a Dutch community sample (n = 929). Nearly 80% of the autistic adults lived independently. Older participants, women, and those with higher self-reported IQ's were more likely to live independently. Autistic adults living independently were equally satisfied with their accommodation and neighborhood as the comparison group, but were less satisfied with their life in general. In both groups, higher satisfaction with accommodation and neighborhood was associated with higher life satisfaction. We advocate further research to better understand and anticipate the housing needs of the growing group of adults with autism.

Both ASD and ADHD have been linked to alterations in reward-related neural processing. However, whether both symptom domains interact and/or have distinct effects on reward processing in healthy and ADHD populations is currently unknown.MethodsWe examined how variance in ASD and ADHD symptoms in individuals with ADHD and healthy participants was related to the behavioural and neural response to reward during a monetary incentive delay (MID) task. Participants (mean age: 17.7 years, range: 10–28 years) from the NeuroIMAGE study with a confirmed diagnosis of ADHD (n = 136), their unaffected siblings (n = 83), as well as healthy controls (n = 105) performed an MID task in a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scanner. ASD and ADHD symptom scores were used as predictors of the neural response to reward anticipation and reward receipt. Behavioural responses were modeled using linear mixed models; neural responses were analysed using FMRIB’s Software Library (FSL) proprietary mixed effects analysis (FLAMEO).ResultsASD and ADHD symptoms were associated with alterations in BOLD activity during reward anticipation, but not reward receipt. Specifically, ASD scores were related to increased insular activity during reward anticipation across the sample. No interaction was found between this effect and the presence of ADHD, suggesting that ASD symptoms had no differential effect in ADHD and healthy populations. ADHD symptom scores were associated with reduced dorsolateral prefrontal activity during reward anticipation. No interactions were found between the effects of ASD and ADHD symptoms on reward processing.ConclusionsVariance in ASD and ADHD symptoms separately influence neural processing during reward anticipation in both individuals with (an increased risk of) ADHD and healthy participants. Our findings therefore suggest that both symptom domains affect reward processing through distinct mechanisms, underscoring the importance of multidimensional and multimodal assessment in psychiatry.","The NeuroIMAGE project was supported by NIH Grant R01MH62873 (to Stephen V.

The underlying mechanisms and the possible causes of autism spectrum disorder remain elusive and while increased prevalence is undoubtable, it is unclear if it is a reflection of diagnostic improvement or emerging risk factors such as endocrine disrupting chemicals. Epidemiological studies, which are used to study the relation between endocrine disrupting chemicals and autism spectrum disorder, can have inherent methodological challenges that limit the quality and strength of their findings. The objective of this work is to systematically review the treatment of these challenges and assess the quality and strength of the findings in the currently available literature. The overall quality and strength were ""moderate"" and ""limited,"" respectively. Risk of bias due to the exclusion of potential confounding factors and the lack of accuracy of exposure assessment methods were the most prevalent. The omnipresence of endocrine disrupting chemicals and the biological plausibility of the association between prenatal exposure and later development of autism spectrum disorder highlight the need to carry out well-designed epidemiological studies that overcome the methodological challenges observed in the currently available literature in order to be able to inform public policy to prevent exposure to these potentially harmful chemicals and aid in the establishment of predictor variables to facilitate early diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder and improve long-term outcomes.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Endocrine Disruptors; Female; Humans; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Risk Factors; Stereotyped Behavior,19/08/2021,2021,19/08/2021,2022-01,26,1,Jun-32,Closed,Article,"Marí-Bauset, Salvador; Peraita-Costa, Isabel; Donat-Vargas, Carolina; Llopis-González, Agustín; Marí-Sanchis, Amelia; Llopis-Morales, Juan; Suárez-Varela, María Morales","Marí-Bauset, Salvador (Unit of Public Health and Environmental Care, Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Sciences, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain); Peraita-Costa, Isabel (Unit of Public Health and Environmental Care, Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Sciences, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain; CIBER in Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Institute of Health Carlos III, Spain); Donat-Vargas, Carolina (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden); Llopis-González, Agustín (Unit of Public Health and Environmental Care, Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Sciences, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain; CIBER in Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Institute of Health Carlos III, Spain); Marí-Sanchis, Amelia (Navarra Hospital Complex, Spain); Llopis-Morales, Juan (Unit of Public Health and Environmental Care, Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Sciences, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain); Suárez-Varela, María Morales (Unit of Public Health and Environmental Care, Department of Preventive Medicine and Public Health, Food Sciences, Toxicology and Forensic Medicine, University of Valencia, Spain; CIBER in Epidemiology and Public Health (CIBERESP), Institute of Health Carlos III, Spain)","Suárez-Varela, María Morales (University of Valencia; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Epidemiología y Salud Pública)","Marí-Bauset, Salvador (University of Valencia); Peraita-Costa, Isabel (University of Valencia; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Epidemiología y Salud Pública); Donat-Vargas, Carolina (Karolinska Institute); Llopis-González, Agustín (University of Valencia; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Epidemiología y Salud Pública); Marí-Sanchis, Amelia (); Llopis-Morales, Juan (University of Valencia); Suárez-Varela, María Morales (University of Valencia; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Epidemiología y Salud Pública)",Karolinska Institute; University of Valencia; Centro de Investigación Biomédica en Red de Epidemiología y Salud Pública,grid.4714.6; grid.5338.d; grid.466571.7,Sweden; Spain; Spain,,0,0,,,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140549741,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/PROSPEROFILES/17890_PROTOCOL_20150226.pdf,Systematic Review,

Although there has been research investigating neurological disorders in autism, the findings are not always conclusive. Previous summaries of existing studies have not evaluated the full range of neurological disorders. This study aimed to comprehensively explore the neurological problems appearing in autism to provide updated information that is needed for better healthcare and support in this population. We looked at already published studies focusing on risk or frequency of neurological disorders in autism. Our results suggest that individuals with autism are more likely than the general population to have a range of neurological disorders, including epilepsy, macrocephaly, hydrocephalus, cerebral palsy, migraine/headache, and inborn abnormalities of the nervous system. In order to provide individualized healthcare and support of high quality to individuals diagnosed with autism, health care professionals and other support providers need to be attentive to neurological complications. To further improve our understanding about the link between autism and neurological disorders, future research should follow the neurological health of children who are diagnosed with or are at increased likelihood of autism.",The authors thank Magdalena Svanberg and Sabina Gillsund for their assistance with the literature search and Nikolas Aho for data extraction.,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Epilepsy; Humans,09/09/2020,2020,09/09/2020,2021-04,25,3,812-830,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Pan, Pei-Yin; Bölte, Sven; Kaur, Preet; Jamil, Sadia; Jonsson, Ulf","Pan, Pei-Yin (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Region Stockholm, Sweden); Bölte, Sven (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Region Stockholm, Sweden; Curtin University, Australia); Kaur, Preet (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Region Stockholm, Sweden); Jamil, Sadia (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Region Stockholm, Sweden); Jonsson, Ulf (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Region Stockholm, Sweden; Uppsala University, Sweden)","Pan, Pei-Yin (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council)","Pan, Pei-Yin (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council); Bölte, Sven (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council; Curtin University); Kaur, Preet (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council); Jamil, Sadia (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council); Jonsson, Ulf (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council; Uppsala University)",Stockholm Regional Council; Curtin University; Uppsala University; Karolinska Institute,grid.425979.4; grid.1032.0; grid.8993.b; grid.4714.6,Sweden; Australia; Sweden; Sweden,,22,21,3.8,,29,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320951370,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1130763132,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=120048,Systematic Review,

Technology used were computer programs (n = 14), tablet apps (n = 3), a robot (n = 1) and an interactive DVD (n = 1). The meta-analysis resulted in an overall effect size (Cohen’s d) of 0.32 [0.12–0.51], indicating a small effect.

Thus, reliable measures are needed to understand the biological underpinnings of these differences. This study aimed to define a scoring methodology specific to auditory (AOR) and tactile (TOR) over-responsivity. Second, in a pilot cohort using MRI Diffusion Tensor Imaging, we performed a proof of concept study of whether children with AOR showed measurable differences in their white matter integrity.MethodsThis study included children with AOR and TOR from a mixed neurodevelopmental disorder cohort including autism and sensory processing dysfunction (n = 176) as well as neurotypical children (n = 128). We established cohorts based on sensory over-responsivity using parent report (Short Sensory Profile (SSP)) and direct assessment (Sensory Processing-Three Dimensions: Assessment (SP-3D:A)) measures. With a subset of the children (n = 39), group comparisons, based on AOR phenotype, were conducted comparing the white matter fractional anisotropy in 23 regions of interest.ResultsUsing direct assessment, 31% of the children with neurodevelopmental disorders had AOR and 27% had TOR. The inter-test agreement between SSP and SP-3D:A for AOR was 65% and TOR was 50%. Children with AOR had three white matter tracts showing decreased fractional anisotropy relative to children without AOR.ConclusionsThis study identified cut-off scores for AOR and TOR using the SSP parent report and SP-3D:A observation. A combination of questionnaire and direct observation measures should be used in clinical and research settings. The SSP parent report and SP-3D:A direct observation ratings overlapped moderately for sensory related behaviors. Based on these preliminary structural neuroimaging results, we suggest a putative neural network may contribute to AOR.",We would like to thank Carly Demopoulos and Sam Payabvash for editorial review.

Within this environment, it is usual to feel anxious and overwhelmed by noises, lights or other people. The narrow scanners, the loud noises and the long examination time can easily cause panic attacks. This review aims to identify any adaptations for autistic individuals to have a magnetic resonance imaging scan without sedation or anaesthesia. Out of 4442 articles screened, 53 more relevant were evaluated and 21 were finally included in this study. Customising communication, different techniques to improve the environment, using technology for familiarisation and distraction have been used in previous studies.

Here, autistic and non-autistic adults (N = 60) matched on age, gender, non-verbal reasoning ability and alexithymia, completed an emotion recognition task, which employed dynamic point light displays of emotional facial expressions manipulated in terms of speed and spatial exaggeration. Autistic participants exhibited significantly lower accuracy for angry, but not happy or sad, facial motion with unmanipulated speed and spatial exaggeration. Autistic, and not alexithymic, traits were predictive of accuracy for angry facial motion with unmanipulated speed and spatial exaggeration.

However, although breastfeeding is 'natural', that does not make it easy and many women experience challenges. Autistic women may face additional barriers to breastfeeding when compared to neurotypical women.What this paper adds?We reviewed all existing evidence on Autistic mothers' infant feeding experiences (22 pieces) and found that although many Autistic women wanted to breastfeed, breastfeeding was difficult for Autistic mothers for three key reasons. First, maternity and infant feeding services were inaccessible and unsupportive to Autistic mothers, meaning they did not receive help when needed. Second, becoming a mother was challenging because of exhaustion, loss of control over routines and a lack of social support. Third, when breastfeeding Autistic mothers experienced sensory challenges, such as 'being touched out', and pain, which could feel unbearable. Despite these difficulties, many Autistic mothers had done a lot of reading about breastfeeding and were determined to breastfeed their babies; some mothers found breastfeeding positive. Infant formula was often viewed as second-best compared to breastmilk, but some mothers found the ritual of preparing bottles of formula to be calming.Implications for practice, research or policyThe findings of this work show that Autistic mothers urgently need better support from health professionals to help meet their breastfeeding goals, including how to remove or reduce the extra barriers being Autistic brings to breastfeeding.","The authors wish to thank the members of the Autistic Breastfeeding, Chestfeeding and Bodyfeeding Parents online support group for their feedback on the design of the study.

The participants were asked to hear (hearing condition), imagine enacting (motor imagery condition) and actually enact (enactment condition) instruction sequences and then recall them orally. Compared with the hearing condition, all groups performed better in the enactment condition, with the greatest advantage exhibited by the TD group; however, only the TD children performed better in the motor imagery condition. In summary, enactment has a weaker facilitating effect on ASD children and ID children than on TD children, and motor imagery is ineffective in the former two groups.","The authors would like to sincerely thank all of the participants who took part in this study.

Two characteristics of ASD could be relevant to insomnia complaints by hampering the entrainment of a circadian sleep-wake rhythm. First, sensory hyper-reactivity could lead to bright light avoidance and thus affect photoperiodic input to the circadian system. Second, impaired social skills complicate the establishment of a social interactions and thus affect scheduled social-behavioral input to the circadian system. We investigated the association of insomnia severity with sensory reactivity and social skills in 631 adults (18–65 years) with ASD. Results revealed positive associations of insomnia severity with general and visual sensory hyper-reactivity and with impairment of social skills.

Despite the challenges to form peer social engagement posed by their unique social-communicative profile, few interventions have targeted peer interactions in the MVAS population. This study explored predictors of individual differences in treatment response among 54 school-age minimally verbal autistic children (8-16 years) following an RCT ""school-based peer social intervention"" (S-PSI) that compared two peer-oriented intervention modalities (conversation versus collaboration) versus a waitlisted control group. We examined autistic-symptom severity, age, verbal and nonverbal IQ, executive functions, and sensory-processing profile for their contribution to children's ability to form relevant spontaneous communication exchanges with a peer partner. Main findings revealed that larger deficits in sensory-processing (sensory-avoidance and sensory low-registration) and in executive functions contributed to greater growth in ""relevant"" (i.e., adequately attuned, participatory, reciprocal) communication following both interventions, but not for the waitlisted controls. Additionally, older participants with lower verbal and nonverbal IQ improved communication's relevancy more after the conversation intervention, whereas the collaboration intervention was more beneficial for younger participants. Lower autistic-symptom severity contributed to larger growth in relevancy for all groups. By identifying individual-level predictors of spontaneous, attuned, participatory, and reciprocal (i.e., ""relevant"") communication exchanges with peers, we optimized S-PSI personalization for this uniquely nonverbal, heterogeneous MVAS population. These new channels for tailoring peer interventions to better meet individuals' needs may result in reduced social isolation and loneliness and enhanced well-being.","Special thanks are extended to Yael Estrugo, Karen Samuel‐Magal, Avner Friedlin, Lior Heishrik, Dror Koren and Shahar Bar–Yehuda for their contribution to the S‐PSI intervention&#x27;s development and evaluation.

Efforts to unravel sex differences in the brain organization of autism have, however, been challenged by the limited availability of female data.MethodsWe addressed this gap by using a large sample of males and females with autism and neurotypical (NT) control individuals (ABIDE; Autism: 362 males, 82 females; NT: 409 males, 166 females; 7–18 years). Discovery analyses examined main effects of diagnosis, sex and their interaction across five resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) metrics (voxel-level Z > 3.1, cluster-level P < 0.01, gaussian random field corrected). Secondary analyses assessed the robustness of the results to different pre-processing approaches and their replicability in two independent samples: the EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) and the Gender Explorations of Neurogenetics and Development to Advance Autism Research.ResultsDiscovery analyses in ABIDE revealed significant main effects of diagnosis and sex across the intrinsic functional connectivity of the posterior cingulate cortex, regional homogeneity and voxel-mirrored homotopic connectivity (VMHC) in several cortical regions, largely converging in the default network midline. Sex-by-diagnosis interactions were confined to the dorsolateral occipital cortex, with reduced VMHC in females with autism. All findings were robust to different pre-processing steps. Replicability in independent samples varied by R-fMRI measures and effects with the targeted sex-by-diagnosis interaction being replicated in the larger of the two replication samples—EU-AIMS LEAP.LimitationsGiven the lack of a priori harmonization among the discovery and replication datasets available to date, sample-related variation remained and may have affected replicability.ConclusionsAtypical cross-hemispheric interactions are neurobiologically relevant to autism. They likely result from the combination of sex-dependent and sex-independent factors with a differential effect across functional cortical networks. Systematic assessments of the factors contributing to replicability are needed and necessitate coordinated large-scale data collection across studies.","The authors thank all investigators and contributors to the Gender Explorations of Neurogenetics and Development to Advance Autism Research (GENDAAR) for collecting and sharing their data as well as addressing question related to the data, the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange, and the contributors to EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project for their efforts in data collection and sharing.

AT-rich interactive domain 1B (ARID1B), a chromatin modifier, has been linked to autism spectrum disorder and to affect rare and inherited genetic variation in a broad set of NDDs.MethodsA novel preclinical mouse model of Arid1b deficiency was created and validated to characterize and define neuroanatomical, behavioral and transcriptional phenotypes. Neuroanatomy was assessed ex vivo in adult animals and in vivo longitudinally from birth to adulthood. Behavioral testing was also performed throughout development and tested all aspects of motor, learning, sociability, repetitive behaviors, seizure susceptibility, and general milestones delays.ResultsWe validated decreased Arid1b mRNA and protein in Arid1b+/− mice, with signatures of increased axonal and synaptic gene expression,  decreased transcriptional regulator and RNA processing expression in adult Arid1b+/− cerebellum. During neonatal development, Arid1b+/− mice exhibited robust impairments in ultrasonic vocalizations (USVs) and metrics of developmental growth. In addition, a striking sex effect was observed neuroanatomically throughout development. Behaviorally, as adults, Arid1b+/− mice showed low motor skills in open field exploration and normal three-chambered approach. Arid1b+/− mice had learning and memory deficits in novel object recognition but not in visual discrimination and reversal touchscreen tasks. Social interactions in the male–female social dyad with USVs revealed social deficits on some but not all parameters. No repetitive behaviors were observed. Brains of adult Arid1b+/− mice had a smaller cerebellum and a larger hippocampus and corpus callosum. The corpus callosum increase seen here contrasts previous reports which highlight losses in corpus callosum volume in mice and humans.LimitationsThe behavior and neuroimaging analyses were done on separate cohorts of mice, which did not allow a direct correlation between the imaging and behavioral findings, and the transcriptomic analysis was exploratory, with no validation of altered expression beyond Arid1b.ConclusionsThis study represents a full validation and investigation of a novel model of Arid1b+/− haploinsufficiency throughout development and highlights the importance of examining both sexes throughout development in NDDs.",,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Animals; Behavior, Animal; Brain; Exploratory Behavior; Fear; Female; Gait; Haploinsufficiency; Learning; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Mice, Mutant Strains; Motor Skills; Neurodevelopmental Disorders; Recognition, Psychology; Social Behavior; Transcription Factors; Vocalization, Animal",23/03/2021,2021,23/03/2021,2021-12,12,1,25,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ellegood, J.; Petkova, S.

The aim of this article is to carry out a systematic literature review of the studies on this topic that were published in the last 10 years. We tried to address the following questions: can social robots be a useful tool in autism therapy? We followed the PRISMA guidelines, and the protocol was registered within PROSPERO database (CRD42015016158). We found many positive implications in the use of social robots in therapy as for example: ASD subjects often performed better with a robot partner rather than a human partner; sometimes, ASD patients had, toward robots, behaviors that TD patients had toward human agents; ASDs had a lot of social behaviors toward robots; during robotic sessions, ASDs showed reduced repetitive and stereotyped behaviors and, social robots manage to improve spontaneous language during therapy sessions. Therefore, robots provide therapists and researchers a means to connect with autistic subjects in an easier way, but studies in this area are still insufficient. It is necessary to clarify whether sex, intelligence quotient, and age of participants affect the outcome of therapy and whether any beneficial effects only occur during the robotic session or if they are still observable outside the clinical/experimental context.",,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Autistic Disorder; Humans; Robotics; Social Behavior,20/10/2015,2015,20/10/2015,2016-02,9,2,165-183,Closed,Article,"Pennisi, Paola; Tonacci, Alessandro; Tartarisco, Gennaro; Billeci, Lucia; Ruta, Liliana; Gangemi, Sebastiano; Pioggia, Giovanni","Pennisi, Paola (Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Messina Unit, 98125, Messina, Italy.; Department of Cognitive Sciences, Educational and Cultural Studies, University of Messina, 98122, Messina, Italy.); Tonacci, Alessandro (Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Pisa Unit, 56124, Pisa, Italy.); Tartarisco, Gennaro (Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Messina Unit, 98125, Messina, Italy.); Billeci, Lucia (Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Pisa Unit, 56124, Pisa, Italy.); Ruta, Liliana (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, 56018 Calambrone, Pisa, Italy.); Gangemi, Sebastiano (Clinical Physiology Institute, National Research Council of Italy (IFC-CNR), Messina Unit, 98125, Messina, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, School and Division of Allergy and Clinical Immunology, University Hospital ""G.

The concept of pathological demand avoidance has been criticised for undermining the self-advocacy of autistic people and neglecting the potential role of anxiety as a possible underlying or contributing cause. The current study was undertaken to summarise and review the methodological quality and findings from current research into pathological demand avoidance in children and adolescents. Further aims were to describe how pathological demand avoidance has been identified and to explore the relationships with autism and other developmental and psychiatric disorders. After a comprehensive search, 13 relevant studies using a wide range of methods were identified and systematic quality assessments were undertaken. All the studies had based the identification of pathological demand avoidance, directly or indirectly, on descriptions from the original study by Newson and colleagues. However, the methods used to develop these criteria were not clearly described. Most studies relied exclusively on parental report for data, and there was a general failure to take account of alternative explanations for the behaviours under study. No studies explored the views of individuals with pathological demand avoidance themselves. Problems concerning definition and measurement in the reviewed studies currently limit any conclusions regarding the uniformity or stability of the behaviours described, or the characteristics of individuals displaying them. Relationships between pathological demand avoidance and other emotional and behavioural difficulties should be explored in future research, as should the perspectives of individuals with pathological demand avoidance themselves.","The authors thank the Norwegian AUP (Autism, Intellectual Disability, Mental Illness) network group for helpful discussions of PDA, and their colleagues Espen Arnfinn Winther Matre, Trine Lise Bakken, Tale Gjertine Bjørgen and Trine Elisabeth Iversen for their input.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Adolescent; Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Humans",28/07/2021,2021,28/07/2021,2021-11,25,8,2162-2176,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Kildahl, Arvid N; Helverschou, Sissel B; Rysstad, Anne L; Wigaard, Elisabeth; Hellerud, Jane MA; Ludvigsen, Linn B; Howlin, Patricia","Kildahl, Arvid N (Oslo University Hospital, Norway); Helverschou, Sissel B (Oslo University Hospital, Norway); Rysstad, Anne L (Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway); Wigaard, Elisabeth (Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway); Hellerud, Jane MA (Oslo University Hospital, Norway); Ludvigsen, Linn B (Vestre Viken Hospital Trust, Norway); Howlin, Patricia (King’s College London, UK)","Kildahl, Arvid N (Oslo University Hospital)","Kildahl, Arvid N (Oslo University Hospital); Helverschou, Sissel B (Oslo University Hospital); Rysstad, Anne L (Vestre Viken Hospital Trust); Wigaard, Elisabeth (Vestre Viken Hospital Trust); Hellerud, Jane MA (Oslo University Hospital); Ludvigsen, Linn B (Vestre Viken Hospital Trust); Howlin, Patricia (King's College London)",Oslo University Hospital; Vestre Viken Hospital Trust; King's College London,grid.55325.34; grid.459157.b; grid.13097.3c,Norway; Norway; United Kingdom,,3,3,,,12,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/13623613211034382,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140006062,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=152573,Systematic Review,Cites deviations from protocol

Yet little research has been conducted that focuses on addressing these health problems. In order to guide future research, it is important to know what intervention studies have been done to improve health outcomes among autistic adults. The project team and student assistants read studies that were published between 2007 and 2018 in the online research database, PubMed. We looked for studies published in English, which were peer-reviewed and included (1) an intervention, (2) an outcome that was related to health, and (3) a study group that included autistic adults. We did not include studies that had outcomes about employment (unless there was a health outcome), studies about caregivers or caregiving, or expert opinions about interventions. Of 778 reviewed articles, 19 studies met all of the criteria above. Within these studies, two approaches were found to have emerging evidence for their use in autistic adults: cognitive behavioral interventions and mindfulness-based approaches for improved mental health outcomes. The remaining intervention approaches did not have enough articles to support their use. Many of the outcomes were about reduced symptoms of co-occurring mental health diagnoses (e.g. reduced anxiety, depression). Most of the participants in these studies were male and did not have intellectual disability. Most study participants were adults younger than 40. There are not many intervention studies that address health outcomes among autistic adults. More research is needed on interventions which are desired by the adult autism community and address preferred health outcomes such as increased quality of life or well-being.","We wish to gratefully acknowledge the contributions of our Autistic Adults and other Stakeholders Engage Together (AASET) Community Council (CC) members.

To investigate the association, we conducted a systematic review registered in PROSPERO (ID:CRD42021236263) with a random-effects meta-analysis. We searched PubMed, Embase, and PsycInfo (last search on January 25, 2021), and manually searched relevant publications. We included observational studies measuring the association between ASD and IBD. The primary outcome was the association (odds ratio, OR) between ASD and later development of IBD. Sensitivity analyses were conducted by quality, confounding adjustment, and study design. We performed meta-regression analyses and assessed heterogeneity, publication bias, and quality of studies with the Newcastle-Ottawa Scale. Overall, we included six studies consisting of eight datasets, including over 11 million participants. We found that ASD was significantly associated with subsequent incident IBD (any IBD, OR = 1.66, 95% confidence interval[CI] = 1.25-2.21, p < 0.001; ulcerative colitis, OR = 1.91, 95%CI = 1.41-2.6, p < 0.001; Crohn's disease, OR = 1.47, 95%CI = 1.15-1.88, p = 0.002). ASD and IBD were also associated regardless of temporal sequence of diagnosis (any IBD, OR = 1.57, 95%CI = 1.28-1.93, p < 0.001; ulcerative colitis, OR = 1.7, 95%CI = 1.36-2.12, p < 0.001; Crohn's disease, OR = 1.37, 95%CI = 1.12-1.69, p = 0.003). Sensitivity analyses confirmed the findings of the main analysis. Meta-regression did not identify any significant moderators. Publication bias was not detected. Quality was high in four datasets and medium in four. In conclusion, our findings highlight the need to screen for IBD in individuals with ASD, and future research should identify who, among those with ASD, has the highest risk of IBD, and elucidate the shared biological mechanisms between ASD and IBD. LAY SUMMARY: This systematic review and meta-analysis of eight observational datasets found that individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) are more likely to develop any inflammatory bowel disease, ulcerative colitis, or Crohn's disease. Our findings highlight the need to screen for inflammatory bowel disease in patients with ASD and elucidate the shared biological mechanisms between the two disorders.",This research was supported by the Basic Science Research Program through the National Research Foundation of Korea (NRF) grant funded by the Korea government (MSIT) (2021R1A2C2010913).,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Autism Spectrum Disorder;

This paper presents the results of a meta-analysis to determine whether the weight of the evidence supports such an association. Studies with a categorical diagnosis of autism as the outcome and an assessment of its association with prenatal maternal infection or fever (or the data necessary to compute this association) were included. A total of 36 studies met these criteria. Two independent reviewers extracted data on study design, methods of assessment, type of infectious agent, site of infection, trimester of exposure, definition of autism, and effect size. Analyses demonstrated a statistically significant association of maternal infection/fever with autism in offspring (OR = 1.32; 95% CI = 1.20-1.46). Adjustment for evident publication bias slightly weakened this association. There was little variation in effect sizes across agent or site of infection. Small differences across trimester of exposure were not statistically significant. There was some evidence that recall bias associated with status on the outcome variable leads to differential misclassification of exposure status. Nonetheless, the overall association is only modestly reduced when studies potentially contaminated by such bias are removed. Although causality has not been firmly established, these findings suggest maternal infection during pregnancy confers an increase in risk for autism in offspring. Given the prevalence of this risk factor, it is possible that the incidence of autism would be reduced by 12%-17% if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner. LAY SUMMARY: This study is a meta-analysis of the association of maternal infection during pregnancy and subsequent autism in offspring. In combining the results from 36 studies of this association we find that a significant relationship is present. The association does not vary much across the types of infections or when they occur during pregnancy. We conclude that the incidence of autism could be substantially reduced if maternal infections could be prevented or safely treated in a timely manner.","This work was supported by the MJS Foundation through support for the Whitaker Scholar Program in Developmental Neuropsychiatry at Columbia University/New York State Psychiatric Institute.

The objective of this study was to investigate if maternal levels of AGA, during pregnancy and at the time of birth, are associated with ASD in offspring. We analyzed AGA in archived neonatal dried blood spots (NDBS) for 921 ASD cases and 1090 controls, and in paired maternal sera collected earlier in pregnancy for a subset of 547 cases and 428 controls. We examined associations with ASD diagnoses as a group and considering common comorbidities (intellectual disability [ID] and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder). We compared 206 cases to their unaffected siblings to examine the potential for confounding by shared familial factors. Odds of ASD tended to be lower among those with the highest levels (≥90th percentile) of AGA compared to those with low levels (<80th percentile; OR 0.78, 95% CI 0.56-1.09, measured in NDBS). This pattern was more apparent for ASD with comorbid ID when measured in NDBS (0.51, 0.30-0.87), with a similar trend in maternal sera (0.55, 0.24-1.29). High levels of AGA were similarly associated with lower odds of ASD in the sibling comparison. In summary, we found little association between maternal antibodies raised against components of gluten and risk of ASD in general. Exposure to high levels of AGA in the pre- and perinatal periods may be protective in terms of risk for ASD with ID. LAY SUMMARY: There is a debate among both scientists and community members as to whether an immune reaction to gluten exposure could be considered a cause of autism. We examined antibodies that are directed against gliadin, a part of gluten, in samples collected from pregnant mothers and their newborn babies. We did not see any major differences in the antibody level among those children diagnosed with ASD or their mothers compared to children who were not diagnosed with ASD. High levels of the antibodies were in fact associated with a somewhat lower risk of ASD with co-occurring intellectual disabilities, though we cannot tell from this study why that might be the case.","We thank Shuojia Yang for her technical expertise in performing the laboratory immunoassays.

125,1939,pub.1136886982,10.1002/aur.2511,33811474,,,Structural and contextual priors affect visual search in children with and without autism,"Bayesian predictive coding theories of autism spectrum disorder propose that impaired acquisition or a broader shape of prior probability distributions lies at the core of the condition. However, we still know very little about how probability distributions are learned and encoded by children, let alone children with autism. Here, we take advantage of a recently developed distribution learning paradigm to characterize how children with and without autism acquire information about probability distributions. Twenty-four autistic and 25-matched neurotypical children searched for an odd-one-out target among a set of distractor lines with orientations sampled from a Gaussian distribution repeated across multiple trials to allow for learning of the parameters (mean and variance) of the distribution. We could measure the width (variance) of the participant's encoded distribution by introducing a target-distractor role-reversal while varying the similarity between target and previous distractor mean. Both groups performed similarly on the visual search task and learned the distractor distribution to a similar extent. However, the variance learned was much broader than the one presented, consistent with less informative priors in children irrespective of autism diagnosis. These findings have important implications for Bayesian accounts of perception throughout development, and Bayesian accounts of autism specifically. LAY SUMMARY: Recent theories about the underlying cognitive mechanisms of autism propose that the way autistic individuals estimate variability or uncertainty in their perceptual environment may differ from how typical individuals do so. Children had to search an oddly tilted line in a set of lines pointing in different directions, and based on their response times we examined how they learned about the variability in a set of objects. We found that autistic children learn variability as well as typical children, but both groups learn with less precision than typical adults do on the same task.","The authors would like to thank all participants and their families for their time and contribution to this research.

Results from an ANOVA demonstrated a significant difference in objectively measured knowledge across disciplines, F(7, 146) = 4.68, p < .001. Specifically, trainees in psychology had significantly higher levels of objectively measured ASD knowledge than trainees in physical/occupational therapy, social work, and non-clinical disciplines.

In a first task, 20 male autistic adults and 20 neuro-typicals had to read and produce native vowels. To assess the extent to which phonetic inflexibility is due to an overall fine-grained control of phonetic behavior or to a lack of flexibility in the realization of one's phonological repertoire, the second task asked participants to reproduce artificial vowel-like sounds. Results confirmed the presence of a greater articulatory stability in the production of native vowels in autistic adults. When instructed to imitate artificial vowel-like sounds, the autistic group did not better approximate the targets' acoustic properties relative to neuro-typicals but their performance at reproducing artificial vowels was less variable and influenced to a greater extent by the articulatory properties of their own vocalic space. These findings suggest that the greater articulatory stability observed in autistic adults arises from a lack of flexibility in the production of their own native vowels. The two phonetic tasks are devoid of any pragmatic constraint, which indicates that phonetic inflexibility in autism is partly independent of register selection. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic and neuro-typical adults took part in two tasks: one in which they produced vowels from French, their native tongue, and the other where they imitated unfamiliar vowels. Autistic adults displayed significantly less variation in their production of different French vowels. In imitating unfamiliar vowels, they were more influenced by the way they pronounce French vowels. These results suggest that the atypical speech style, frequently attested in autistic individuals, could stem from an unusually stable pronunciation of speech sounds.",We thank two anonymous reviewers for their comments on a previous version of this paper.

This so-called parkinsonism was remarkably prevalent in middle-aged and older autistic adults in two independent studies (Dutch study: 50-81 years, 183 males, 113 females, all adulthood diagnoses; the USA study: 50-83 years, 110 females, 109 males, majority adulthood diagnosis). Parkinsonism can be part of the progressive motor disease-Parkinson's disease. Therefore, it is important that future studies, including in-person neurological assessment, determine if (and if so, why) autistic adults who report these motor features are at increased risk for developing Parkinson's disease.","The authors especially thank Professor Dr Ben Schmand, a clinical neuropsychologist who kindly commented on various drafts of the current manuscript.

Currently, educational policies in many countries underscore the rights of students with autism to be educated in mainstream schools. While there is some knowledge on school outcomes among students with autism from older studies, little is known about rates of qualification for upper secondary education among children with autism in mainstream schools today. This lack of knowledge is problematic since autism is diagnosed more widely, and prior evidence may not be relevant for individuals with autism and their families today. Using Swedish registers, we therefore examined this in a study including all children and young people in Stockholm County in 2001 through 2011. We found that about two thirds of children with autism without intellectual disability qualified for upper secondary education at the expected age, in comparison with about nine in ten among typically developing peers. We also found that girls with autism had further difficulties obtaining such qualification than boys and that those who were additionally diagnosed with attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder were particularly at risk of non-qualification. Finally, students with autism without intellectual disability had a greater chance of completing compulsory education if given an extended period to graduate. These findings underline the need for supportive interventions for children with autism during compulsory school. They may also challenge the inclusive education policy adopted by majority of western countries, at least in the wake of addressing special needs in mainstream schooling.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Educational Status; Female; Humans; Intellectual Disability; Male; Sweden,27/11/2020,2020,27/11/2020,2021-05,25,4,1036-1046,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Stark, Isidora; Liao, Peiwen; Magnusson, Cecilia; Lundberg¹, Michael; Rai, Dheeraj; Lager, Anton; Nordström, Selma Idring","Stark, Isidora (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden); Liao, Peiwen (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; University of New South Wales (UNSW), Australia); Magnusson, Cecilia (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Stockholm County Council, Sweden); Lundberg¹, Michael (); Rai, Dheeraj (University of Bristol, UK); Lager, Anton (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Stockholm County Council, Sweden); Nordström, Selma Idring (Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Stockholm County Council, Sweden)","Stark, Isidora (Karolinska Institute)","Stark, Isidora (Karolinska Institute); Liao, Peiwen (Karolinska Institute; UNSW Sydney); Magnusson, Cecilia (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council); Lundberg¹, Michael (); Rai, Dheeraj (University of Bristol); Lager, Anton (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council); Nordström, Selma Idring (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council)",UNSW Sydney; Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council; University of Bristol,grid.1005.4; grid.4714.6; grid.425979.4; grid.5337.2,Australia; Sweden; Sweden; United Kingdom,Swedish Research Council for Health Working Life and Welfare,3,3,0.63,1.55,3,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320975929,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133120173,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,4 Quality Education,No,,,

Yet, the influence of such non-language factors as children’s age, the severity of autistic traits, and non-verbal IQ on language functioning was studied. Our results indicate a high variability of language skills in children with ASD (from normal to impaired) which is in line with the previous studies. Interestingly, the number of children with normal language abilities was related to the linguistic levels: according to more complex morphosyntax and discourse tests, fewer children with ASD were within the normal range unlike the results in simpler phonological and lexical tests. Importantly, we found that language abilities were best predicted by non-verbal IQ but were independent from age and the severity of autistic traits. The findings support the claim that formal language assessment of children with ASD needs to include all linguistic levels, from phonology to discourse, for helping speech-language therapists to choose an appropriate therapy target.","The study has been funded by the Center for Language and Brain NRU Higher School of Economics, RF Government Grant ag. № 14.641.31.0004.

Employers (N = 84) were randomised to the IEST™ or support as usual groups. Measurements of self-efficacy, knowledge and attitudes towards disability in the workplace were obtained at baseline and post-test. Results revealed a significant improvement in self-efficacy within the IEST™ group between baseline and post-test (p = 0.016). At post-test, there were no significant differences between groups in relation to self-efficacy in implementing autism-specific workplace modifications and employer attitudes towards disability in the workplace.

Complementing this approach by studying cohorts of infants with monogenic syndromes associated with high rates of ASD offers the opportunity to elucidate the factors that lead to ASD.MethodsWe present the first report from a prospective study of ten 10-month-old infants with neurofibromatosis type 1 (NF1), a monogenic disorder with high prevalence of ASD or ASD symptomatology. We compared data from infants with NF1 to a large cohort of infants at familial risk for ASD, separated by outcome at age 3 of ASD (n = 34), atypical development (n = 44), or typical development (n = 89), and low-risk controls (n = 75). Domains assessed at 10 months by parent report and examiner observation include cognitive and adaptive function, sensory processing, social engagement, and temperament.ResultsInfants with NF1 showed striking impairments in motor functioning relative to low-risk infants; this pattern was seen in infants with later ASD from the familial cohort (HR-ASD). Both infants with NF1 and the HR-ASD group showed communication delays relative to low-risk infants.ConclusionsTen-month-old infants with NF1 show a range of developmental difficulties that were particularly striking in motor and communication domains. As with HR-ASD infants, social skills at this age were not notably impaired. This is some of the first information on early neurodevelopment in NF1. Strong inferences are limited by the sample size, but the findings suggest implications for early comparative developmental science and highlight motor functioning as an important domain to inform the development of relevant animal models. The findings have clinical implications in indicating an important focus for early surveillance and remediation in this early diagnosed genetic disorder.","We would like to thank the families who have participated in our research. +The EDEN-BASIS team includes Simon Baron-Cohen, Jannath Begum-Ali, Patrick Bolton, Celeste Cheung, Leila Dafner, Kim Davies, Mayada Elsabbagh, Janice Fernandes, Laurel Fish, Isobel Gammer, Marian Greensmith, Teodora Gliga, Sarah Kalwarowsky, Michelle Liew, Greg Pasco, Andrew Pickles, Helena Ribeiro, Erica Salomone, Chloe Taylor, Leslie Tucker, and Sam Wass, the NF1 Clinical consortium: Manchester NF1 service Emma Burkitt-Wright, D Gareth Evans, Grace Vassallo, Judith Eelloo, Siobhan West, Elizabeth Howard, Eileen Hupton, Sue Huson, Lauren Lewis, and Karen Tricker, the Yorkshire Regional NF1 service Angus Dobbie, Ruth Drimer, and Saghira Malik Sharif, the Southampton Clinical Genetics Service Diane Baralle and Carolyn Redman, the West Midlands Regional Clinical Genetics Unit Saba Sharif and Carolyn Symth, the Edinburgh Genetic Service Wayne Lam, the Sheffield NF1 clinic Alyson Bradbury, Neil Harrower, and Oliver Quarrell, the Newcastle NF1 service Helen Bethell, Rachel Jones, Susan Musson, Catherine Prem, and Miranda Splitt, the Sunderland NF1 clinic Karen Horridge, the Wirral University Hospitals NF1 clinic Christine Steiger, and the Service User collaborator Carly Jim.

Depression, Anxiety, and Stress Scales (DASS-21) and Connor-Davidson Resilience Scale 25-item were administered. Logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with psychological ill-effects and resilience. DASS-21 depression, anxiety and stress scores were high; these were associated with difficulties with infection control measures, autism diagnosis, and need for early intervention services. For caregivers of children with ASD, our DASS-21 scores were significantly higher than non-pandemic scores locally and in other Asian sites. Resilience scores correlated inversely with DASS-21 scores.

To examine the effect of sounds on decision-making, we developed a supermarket task where people watched a film shown from the shopper's perspective and were asked to make decisions between different products. The task was divided into three sections and participants completed each section in a different auditory environment: (1) no sounds, (2) non-social sounds (e.g. fridges humming) and (3) social sounds (e.g. people talking). Thirty-eight autistic and 37 neurotypical adults took part. We measured decision-making by examining how long it took to make a decision and how consistent people were with their decisions. We also measured heart rate variability because this biological response provides a measure of anxiety. After the supermarket shopping task, participants told us in their own words about their experiences. Autistic participants said that they found the non-social and social sound conditions more difficult than the no sound condition, and autistic participants found the social sound condition more negative than neurotypical participants. However, decision-making and heart rate variability were similar for autistic and neurotypical participants across the sound conditions, suggesting that these measures may not have been sensitive enough to reflect the experiences the autistic participants reported. Further research should consider alternative measures to explore the experiences reported by autistic people to help us understand which specific aspects of the environment autistic people are sensitive to. This, in turn, may enable more specific and evidence-based autism-friendly changes to be made.","The authors are grateful to all the participants and their families and other carers for making the study possible.

However, little is known about attention performance in their unaffected siblings. This study aimed to investigate the ADHD-related traits and attention performance in unaffected siblings of probands with autism and Asperger syndrome (AS), as well as the clinical correlates of ADHD-related traits.MethodsWe assessed the intention, hyperactivity-impulsivity, and oppositional symptoms, and attention profiles of 199 probands with a diagnosis of ASD (122 autism, 77 AS), their unaffected siblings, and 196 typically developing controls (TD) by their parents’ reports on the ADHD-related symptoms and the Connors' Continuous Performance Test (CCPT), respectively.ResultsCompared to TD, unaffected siblings of ASD probands were more hyperactive/impulsive and oppositional, particularly unaffected siblings of AS probands. In CCPT, unaffected siblings of AS have intermediate levels of performance between probands with AS and TD on focused attention and sustained attention but were not statistically different from AS probands or TD in these attention profiles. In contrast, unaffected siblings of autism probands have significantly better CCPT performance when compared to autism probands but not to TD. In addition, stereotyped behaviors predicted ADHD-related traits in both sibling groups, but distinctive patterns of other correlates for ADHD-related traits were found between the two sibling groups.ConclusionsThis work suggested that unaffected siblings of AS, but not autism, have more hyperactive/impulsive traits and a trend of pervasive attention deficits assessed by CCPT which might serve as potential endophenotypes for genetic studies in AS.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01582256",We would like to express our thanks to the participants and their parents for their contribution to this study.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Adolescent; Asperger Syndrome; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Siblings,25/07/2017,2017,25/07/2017,2017-12,8,1,37,All OA; Gold,Article,"Chien, Yi-Ling; Chou, Miao-Chun; Chiu, Yen-Nan; Chou, Wen-Jiun; Wu, Yu-Yu; Tsai, Wen-Che; Gau, Susan Shur-Fen","Chien, Yi-Ling (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, No.7, Chung-Shan South Road, 10002, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan); Chou, Miao-Chun (Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical Center, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan); Chiu, Yen-Nan (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, No.7, Chung-Shan South Road, 10002, Taipei, Taiwan); Chou, Wen-Jiun (Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Kaohsiung Medical Center, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Kaohsiung City, Taiwan); Wu, Yu-Yu (Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital- Linkou Medical Center, Chang Gung University College of Medicine, Taoyuan, Taiwan); Tsai, Wen-Che (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, No.7, Chung-Shan South Road, 10002, Taipei, Taiwan); Gau, Susan Shur-Fen (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, No.7, Chung-Shan South Road, 10002, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Clinical Medicine, College of Medicine, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan)","Gau, Susan Shur-Fen (National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University)","Chien, Yi-Ling (National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University); Chou, Miao-Chun (); Chiu, Yen-Nan (National Taiwan University Hospital); Chou, Wen-Jiun (); Wu, Yu-Yu (Chang Gung University); Tsai, Wen-Che (National Taiwan University Hospital); Gau, Susan Shur-Fen (National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University)",Chang Gung University; National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University,grid.145695.a; grid.412094.a; grid.19188.39,Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan,,24,13,1.32,5.96,14,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-017-0153-9,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090891445,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,

For the specific parent-rated temperament scales, most observed significant associations appeared to be specific for either ASD or ADHD symptoms. Indeed, by controlling for overlapping symptoms a different pattern of associations emerged. These results illustrate how temperamental measures may signal risk for later ASD versus ADHD symptomatology in infants at elevated likelihood for ASD. In addition, they indicate the potential of adopting a broader view on neurodevelopmental disorders by investigating not only ASD traits, but also co-occurring disorders such as ADHD in samples of elevated likelihood for ASD.",This study was funded by grants to TFY from Riksbankens Jubileumsfond (Dnr.

This is the first systematic review to synthesize the literature on autistic people's experiences of stigma and coping strategies. 2877 studies were screened and 27 were included in this review. The reviewed literature demonstrates that autistic individuals are acutely aware of being stereotyped, judged, and discriminated by others. Autistic people also show signs of internalizing stigma, rendering them more vulnerable to low self-worth and poorer mental health. To manage the impact of stigma, the included studies suggest that autistic individuals may use these strategies: concealment and camouflaging, selective disclosure and self-advocacy, as well as positive reframing and reconstructing identity. However, the evidence is limited and mixed in terms of how helpful and effective these strategies are. Future studies should include autistic populations with a wider range of intellectual abilities and explore interventions that can support autistic people in managing stigma to supplement interventions that seek to reduce stigma towards autistic people. The power of language in perpetuating and challenging stigma also has important implications for research and practice, underscoring the need for researchers and practitioners to reflect carefully on the messages they are communicating about autism.","Funding for this study was provided by University College London (UCL).

Given the easy access to multiple video conferencing platforms, many healthcare services have moved to an online delivery format (i.e. telehealth). It is important to monitor the behavioral and neural effects of telehealth interventions and resume neuroimaging research while adopting public health safety protocols to control the risk of COVID-19 transmission. We summarize existing safety protocols and our own experience from in-person functional near-infrared spectroscopy neuroimaging data collection (on-site, at home, and in outdoor settings), as well as potential opportunities of using online data sharing and low-cost, remote neuroimaging/electrophysiological techniques to continue brain research during the pandemic.","We thank all the children and families who participated in this study, the undergraduate students Marissa Heino, Sarah Williams, Emily Longenecker, Emma Fallon, and Hannah Laue from the University of Delaware, and undergraduate students Catherine Myers and Amber Bardsley at the University of Connecticut for their help with data collections and data analysis.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; COVID-19; Child; Humans; Pandemics; SARS-CoV-2; Telemedicine,09/04/2021,2021,09/04/2021,2021-08,25,6,1816-1822,All OA; Green,Article,"Su, Wan-Chun; Srinivasan, Sudha; Cleffi, Corina; Bhat, Anjana","Su, Wan-Chun (University of Delaware, USA); Srinivasan, Sudha (University of Connecticut, USA); Cleffi, Corina (University of Delaware, USA); Bhat, Anjana (University of Delaware, USA)","Bhat, Anjana (University of Delaware)","Su, Wan-Chun (University of Delaware); Srinivasan, Sudha (University of Connecticut); Cleffi, Corina (University of Delaware); Bhat, Anjana (University of Delaware)",University of Connecticut; University of Delaware,grid.63054.34; grid.33489.35,United States; United States,Office of the Director; National Institute of General Medical Sciences,10,10,,,4,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8324564,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137050194,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,No,,,

Two subgroups improved after SST. Characterizing the subgroups based on participant and intervention characteristics showed that improvement was related to lower parent-reported perceived difficulty of social-communicative skills at start, higher verbal ability, younger age and milder symptoms of ASD and anxiety. The lowest performing non-improving subgroup participated more often in SST without parent/teacher involvement, compared to all other subgroups. Response to SST in ASD seems to vary depending on participant characteristics.","The authors gratefully acknowledge all the children, their parents, teachers, and therapists participating in this study.

Therefore, maternal conditions characterized by hyperandrogenism such as polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) or hirsutism may be relevant to child ASD. We previously found in a large Swedish case-control study of 23,748 ASD cases and 208,796 matched controls that PCOS in mothers is associated with increased offspring risk of ASD. In the same sample, we have now examined whether maternal diagnoses of hirsutism were associated with ASD. In both unadjusted logistic regression models and models adjusted for a variety of covariates, hirsutism was associated with higher odds of ASD. The most adjusted odds ratios for associations with ASD for hirsutism diagnosis before birth and lifetime diagnosis of hirsutism were 1.64 (95% CI: 0.94, 2.83) and 1.26 (95% CI: 1.01, 1.57), respectively. The presence of an association of maternal hirsutism with child ASD is consistent with the hypothesis that androgens may be involved in the etiology of ASD.

Since identifying maternal biomarkers associated with ASD risk in offspring during early pregnancy might result in new strategies for intervention, we investigated maternal metabolic biomarkers in relation to occurrence of ASD in offspring using both univariate logistic regression and multivariate network analysis.MethodsSerum samples from 100 women with an offspring diagnosed with ASD and 100 matched control women with typically developing offspring were collected at week 14 of pregnancy. Concentrations of 62 metabolic biomarkers were determined, including amino acids, vitamins (A, B, D, E, and K), and biomarkers related to folate (vitamin B9) metabolism, lifestyle factors, as well as C-reactive protein (CRP), the kynurenine-tryptophan ratio (KTR), and neopterin as markers of inflammation and immune activation.ResultsWe found weak evidence for a positive association between higher maternal serum concentrations of folate and increased occurrence of ASD (OR per 1 SD increase: 1.70, 95% CI 1.22–2.37, FDR adjusted P = 0.07). Multivariate network analysis confirmed expected internal biochemical relations between the biomarkers. Neither inflammation markers nor vitamin D3 levels, all hypothesized to be involved in ASD etiology, displayed associations with ASD occurrence in the offspring.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that high maternal serum folate status during early pregnancy may be associated with the occurrence of ASD in offspring. No inference about physiological mechanisms behind this observation can be made at the present time because blood folate levels may have complex relations with nutritional intake, the cellular folate status and status of other B-vitamins. Therefore, further investigations, which may clarify the potential role and mechanisms of maternal blood folate status in ASD risk and the interplay with other potential risk factors, in larger materials are warranted.","We thank all the participants for granting permission to use the blood serum samples in this study, biochemical laboratory Bevital for carrying out biochemical analyzes, and the University of Umeå for providing financial support.",Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Biomarkers; Case-Control Studies; Female; Folic Acid; Humans; Male; Mothers; Pregnancy; Pregnancy Trimester, First",16/01/2020,2020,16/01/2020,2020-12,11,1,7,All OA; Gold,Article,"Egorova, Olga; Myte, Robin; Schneede, Jörn; Hägglöf, Bruno; Bölte, Sven; Domellöf, Erik; Ivars A’roch, Barbro; Elgh, Fredrik; Ueland, Per Magne; Silfverdal, Sven-Arne","Egorova, Olga (Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden); Myte, Robin (Department of Radiation Sciences, Oncology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden); Schneede, Jörn (Department of Clinical Pharmacology, Pharmacology and Clinical Neurosciences, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden); Hägglöf, Bruno (Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Umea University, Umeå, Sweden); Bölte, Sven (Center of Neurodevelopmental Disorders (KIND), Centre for Psychiatry Research, Stockholm, Sweden; Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet & Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Stockholm Health Care Services, Region Stockholm, Stockholm, Sweden; Curtin Autism Research Group, School of Occupational Therapy, Social Work and Speech Pathology, Curtin University, Perth, WA, Australia); Domellöf, Erik (Department of Psychology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden); Ivars A’roch, Barbro (Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Umea University, Umeå, Sweden); Elgh, Fredrik (Department of Clinical Microbiology, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden); Ueland, Per Magne (Bevital AS, Department of Clinical Science, University of Bergen, Bergen, Norway; Department of Medical Biochemistry and Pharmacology, Haukeland University Hospital, Bergen, Norway); Silfverdal, Sven-Arne (Department of Clinical Sciences, Pediatrics, Umeå University, Umeå, Sweden)","Egorova, Olga (Umeå University)","Egorova, Olga (Umeå University); Myte, Robin (Umeå University); Schneede, Jörn (Umeå University); Hägglöf, Bruno (Umeå University); Bölte, Sven (Stockholm Health Care Services; Curtin University); Domellöf, Erik (Umeå University); Ivars A’roch, Barbro (Umeå University); Elgh, Fredrik (Umeå University); Ueland, Per Magne (University of Bergen; Haukeland University Hospital); Silfverdal, Sven-Arne (Umeå University)",University of Bergen; Umeå University; Curtin University; Haukeland University Hospital; Stockholm Health Care Services,grid.7914.b; grid.12650.30; grid.1032.0; grid.412008.f; grid.467087.a,Norway; Sweden; Australia; Norway; Sweden,,28,22,3.44,20.13,11,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-020-0315-z,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124132431,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,,No,,,

Autistic individuals often report a preference for certainty and experience levels of anxiety that can interfere with their daily life. Understanding more about the link between the intolerance of uncertainty and anxiety in autistic people might lead to better treatments for anxiety being developed. Therefore, this work aimed to review previous research in order to explore this link. Twelve studies were found and their results were compared and contrasted. The autistic people who participated in the studies completed questionnaires that suggested a large number of them experienced very high levels of anxiety and intolerance of uncertainty. Of 10 studies that used relevant statistics, nine found a statistically significant link between anxiety and the intolerance of uncertainty. In general, the strength of the link was about the same as previous research found in people who did not have a diagnosis of autism. This might mean that interventions that aim to help people who are intolerant of uncertainty could be effective for autistic individuals.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Anxiety; Anxiety Disorders; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Humans; Uncertainty,22/06/2020,2020,22/06/2020,2020-11,24,8,1933-1944,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Jenkinson, Richard; Milne, Elizabeth; Thompson, Andrew","Jenkinson, Richard (The University of Sheffield, UK); Milne, Elizabeth (The University of Sheffield, UK); Thompson, Andrew (Cardiff University, UK)","Jenkinson, Richard (University of Sheffield)","Jenkinson, Richard (University of Sheffield); Milne, Elizabeth (University of Sheffield); Thompson, Andrew (Cardiff University)",Cardiff University; University of Sheffield,grid.5600.3; grid.11835.3e,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,,32,29,4.85,14.06,23,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320932437,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128665832,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=125315,Systematic Review,

While several studies show that oxytocin (OT) modulates neural activation in social-related neural regions, the mechanism that underlies OT effects in ASD is not fully known yet. Despite evidence from animal studies on connections between the oxytocinergic system and excitation/inhibition neural balance, the influence of OT on oscillatory responses among individuals with ASD has been rarely examined. To bridge these gaps in knowledge, we investigated the effects of OT on both social and non-social stimuli while focusing on its specific influence on the neural connectivity between three socially related neural regions—the left and right fusiform and the medial frontal cortex.
MethodsTwenty-five adolescents with ASD participated in a wall-established social task during a randomized, double-blind placebo-controlled MEG and OT administration study. Our main task was a social-related task that required the identification of social and non-social-related pictures. We hypothesized that OT would modulate the oscillatory connectivity between three pre-selected regions of interest to be more adaptive to social processing. Specifically, we focused on alpha and gamma bands which are known to play an important role in face processing and top-down/bottom-up balance.
ResultsCompared to placebo, OT reduced the connectivity between the medial frontal cortex and the fusiform in the low gamma more for social stimuli than for non-social ones, a reduction that was correlated with individuals’ performance in the task. Additionally, for both social and non-social stimuli, OT increased the connectivity in the alpha and beta bands.LimitationsSample size was determined based on sample sizes previously reported in MEG in clinical populations, especially OT administration studies in combination with neuroimaging in ASD. We were limited in our capability to recruit for such a study, and as such, the sample size was not based on a priori power analysis. Additionally, we limited our analyses to specific neural bands and regions. To validate the current results, future studies may be needed to explore other parameters using whole-brain approaches in larger samples.ConclusionThese results suggest that OT influenced social perception by modifying the communication between frontal and posterior regions, an attenuation that potentially impacts both social and non-social early perception. We also show that OT influences differ between top-down and bottom-up processes, depending on the social context. Overall, by showing that OT influences both social-related perception and overall attention during early processing stages, we add new information to the existing understanding of the impact of OT on neural processing in ASD. Furthermore, by highlighting the influence of OT on early perception, we provide new directions for treatments for difficulties in early attentional phases in this population.Trial registration Registered on October 27, 2021—Retrospectively registered, https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT05096676 (details on clinical registration can be found in www.clinicalTrial.gov, unique identifier: NCT05096676).",A special thanks to all the adolescents and their families who participated in this study.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Administration, Intranasal; Animals; Autistic Disorder; Double-Blind Method; Facial Recognition; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Oxytocin; Social Perception",05/09/2022,2022,05/09/2022,,13,1,36,All OA; Gold,Article,"Korisky, Adi; Gordon, Ilanit; Goldstein, Abraham","Korisky, Adi (The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University, 5290002, Ramat Gan, Israel); Gordon, Ilanit (The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University, 5290002, Ramat Gan, Israel; Department of Psychology, Bar-Ilan University, 5290002, Ramat Gan, Israel); Goldstein, Abraham (The Gonda Multidisciplinary Brain Research Center, Bar-Ilan University, 5290002, Ramat Gan, Israel; Department of Psychology, Bar-Ilan University, 5290002, Ramat Gan, Israel)","Gordon, Ilanit (Bar-Ilan University; Bar-Ilan University)","Korisky, Adi (Bar-Ilan University); Gordon, Ilanit (Bar-Ilan University; Bar-Ilan University); Goldstein, Abraham (Bar-Ilan University; Bar-Ilan University)",Bar-Ilan University,grid.22098.31,Israel,Israel Science Foundation,2,2,,,3,https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13229-022-00513-6,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1150770716,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,Yes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/record/NCT05096676?view=record,Intervention,Retrospective Registration.

Nonetheless, it is unclear to what extent such markers generalize to new speech samples collected, for example, using a different speech task or in a different language. In this paper, we systematically assess the generalizability of ML findings across a variety of contexts. We train promising published ML models of vocal markers of autism on novel cross-linguistic datasets following a rigorous pipeline to minimize overfitting, including cross-validated training and ensemble models. We test the generalizability of the models by testing them on (i) different participants from the same study, performing the same task; (ii) the same participants, performing a different (but similar) task; (iii) a different study with participants speaking a different language, performing the same type of task. While model performance is similar to previously published findings when trained and tested on data from the same study (out-of-sample performance), there is considerable variance between studies. Crucially, the models do not generalize well to different, though similar, tasks and not at all to new languages. The ML pipeline is openly shared. Generalizability of ML models of vocal markers of autism is an issue. We outline three recommendations for strategies researchers could take to be more explicit about generalizability and improve it in future studies. LAY SUMMARY: Machine learning approaches promise to be able to identify autism from voice only. These models underestimate how diverse the contexts in which we speak are, how diverse the languages used are and how diverse autistic voices are. Machine learning approaches need to be more careful in defining their limits and generalizability.","We are very grateful to the participants in our studies and to the researchers and clinical practitioners who supported the collection of the data we analyzed in this project.

A recent meta-analysis highlighted shortcomings in the field, in particular small sample sizes and study heterogeneity. We showcase a cumulative (i.e., explicitly building on previous studies both conceptually and statistically) yet self-correcting (i.e., critically assessing the impact of cumulative statistical techniques) approach to prosody in ASD to overcome these issues. We relied on the recommendations contained in the meta-analysis to build and analyze a cross-linguistic corpus of multiple speech productions in 77 autistic and 72 neurotypical children and adolescents (>1000 recordings in Danish and US English). We used meta-analytically informed and skeptical priors, with informed priors leading to more generalizable inference. We replicated findings of a minimal cross-linguistically reliable distinctive acoustic profile for ASD (higher pitch and longer pauses) with moderate effect sizes. We identified novel reliable differences between the two groups for normalized amplitude quotient, maxima dispersion quotient, and creakiness. However, the differences were small, and there is likely no one acoustic profile characterizing all autistic individuals. We identified reliable relations of acoustic features with individual differences (age, gender), and clinical features (speech rate and ADOS sub-scores). Besides cumulatively building our understanding of acoustic atypicalities in ASD, the study shows how to use systematic reviews and meta-analyses to guide the design and analysis of follow-up studies. We indicate future directions: larger and more diverse cross-linguistic datasets, focus on heterogeneity, self-critical cumulative approaches, and open science. LAY SUMMARY: Autistic individuals are reported to speak in distinctive ways. Distinctive vocal production can affect social interactions and social development and could represent a noninvasive way to support the assessment of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We systematically checked whether acoustic atypicalities highlighted in previous articles could be actually found across multiple recordings and two languages. We find a minimal acoustic profile of ASD: higher pitch, longer pauses, increased hoarseness and creakiness of the voice. However, there is much individual variability (by age, sex, language, and clinical characteristics). This suggests that the search for one common ""autistic voice"" might be naive and more fine-grained approaches are needed.",We are very grateful to the participants in our studies as well as to the researchers and clinical practitioners who in various guises supported the collection of the data we analyzed in this project.

CONCLUSION: We did not find any evidence to corroborate previous reports of a reduced risk for autism spectrum disorders in offspring of women using folic acid supplements in early pregnancy.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Denmark; Dietary Supplements; Female; Folic Acid; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Odds Ratio; Preconception Care; Pregnancy; Prenatal Care; Risk Factors; Vitamin B Complex; Vitamins; Young Adult,25/09/2015,2015,25/09/2015,2016-08,20,6,710-718,Closed,Article,"Virk, Jasveer; Liew, Zeyan; Olsen, Jørn; Nohr, Ellen A; Catov, Janet M; Ritz, Beate","Virk, Jasveer (UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, USA); Liew, Zeyan (UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, USA); Olsen, Jørn (Aarhus University, Denmark); Nohr, Ellen A (Odense University Hospital, Denmark); Catov, Janet M (University of Pittsburgh, USA); Ritz, Beate (UCLA Fielding School of Public Health, University of California, Los Angeles, USA)","Virk, Jasveer (University of California, Los Angeles)","Virk, Jasveer (University of California, Los Angeles); Liew, Zeyan (University of California, Los Angeles); Olsen, Jørn (Aarhus University); Nohr, Ellen A (Odense University Hospital); Catov, Janet M (University of Pittsburgh); Ritz, Beate (University of California, Los Angeles)","University of Pittsburgh; Aarhus University; Odense University Hospital; University of California, Los Angeles",grid.21925.3d; grid.7048.b; grid.7143.1; grid.19006.3e,United States; Denmark; Denmark; United States,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,48,9,2.68,12.53,92,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1047424164,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,,No,,,

Our data include all children diagnosed with ASD (n = 4441) according to Finnish Hospital Discharge Register in 1987–2000. Four controls per each case were matched to sex, birthplace, date of birth (±30 days) and residence in Finland (n = 17,695). The prevalence of specific congenital syndromes in the Finnish Register of Congenital Malformations was evaluated among the ASD group and the controls by sex. The results of this study suggest that there is an association between several etiologically different syndromes and ASD when compared to controls without ASD. Statistically significant associations were observed with 47,XYY, Sotos syndrome, neurofibromatosis I, and syndrome not otherwise specified. Syndromes were more common among males with ASD compared to controls.

In autism, greater trial-to-trial variability (TTV) in sensory neural responses suggest that the system is more unstable. However, these findings have only been identified in the amplitude and not in the timing of neural responses, and have not been fully explored in schizophrenia. TTV in event-related potential amplitudes and inter-trial coherence (ITC) were assessed in the auditory mismatch negativity (MMN) in autism, schizophrenia, and controls. MMN was largest in autism and smallest in schizophrenia, and TTV was greater in autism and schizophrenia compared to controls. There were no differences in ITC. Greater TTV appears to be characteristic of both autism and schizophrenia, implicating several neural mechanisms that could underlie sensory instability.","We thank Patricia McCarroll and Michelle Perrin from the Center For Autism Research (CeFAR) at the University of Pittsburgh, Vanessa Fishel and Natasha Torrence from UPMC, and Chinmaya Lele from Carnegie Mellon University for their help in recruiting participants.

Multi-group factorial invariance analysis of the online survey data found evidence for metric non-invariance of the SBQ-R, particularly for items three (communication of suicidal intent) and four (likelihood of suicide attempt in the future). Cognitive interviews revealed that autistic adults did not interpret these items as intended by the tool designers.

An interrupted treatment design was employed to determine whether children were able to maintain treatment effects following the removal of TR. Teacher ratings indicated that participating children with autism significantly increased their social interaction, improved their sensory processing, and decreased the severity of symptoms associated with autism spectrum disorders following TR. Gains were not maintained consistently after two 6-week breaks from TR, but were recovered once TR was reinstated. Potential explanations regarding the benefits of TR are discussed, and suggestions for future research provided.","The authors wish to acknowledge the contributions of Wade Johnson, M.D. to the design and critique of this study.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Autistic Disorder; Child; Communication; Equine-Assisted Therapy; Female; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Social Behavior; Treatment Outcome,01/02/2013,2013,01/02/2013,2013-09,43,9,2190-2198,Closed,Article,"Ward, Sandra C.; Whalon, Kelly; Rusnak, Katrina; Wendell, Kimberly; Paschall, Nancy","Ward, Sandra C.

This has tended to focus on parent reports and experiments, rather than asking autistic people about their own experiences and preferences regarding communication.What does this article add?This article is the first to ask autistic adults how they prefer to communicate in different scenarios. We asked whether they preferred to use a range of methods, such email, phone calls, letters and live messaging, in scenarios from education to customer services to friends and family. When contacting unknown people or organisations, we found that generally email was preferred, and phone calls were very unpopular. However, for friends, family and people they felt comfortable with, they preferred both face-to-face and written forms of communication (e.g. email and text message).Implications for practice, research or policyThe findings suggest that services should move away from a reliance on phone calls for communication. They should make sure that access to support is not dependent on the phone, and instead offer written options such as email and live messaging which are more accessible. Future research should investigate the impact of COVID-19 on autistic people's communication preferences, as video calling has become much more commonly used and potentially combines benefits and challenges of other modes discussed in this article.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; COVID-19; Child; Communication; Humans; SARS-CoV-2,25/06/2021,2021,25/06/2021,2021-11,25,8,2265-2278,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Howard, Philippa L; Sedgewick, Felicity","Howard, Philippa L (University of Bristol, UK); Sedgewick, Felicity (University of Bristol, UK)","Howard, Philippa L (University of Bristol)","Howard, Philippa L (University of Bristol); Sedgewick, Felicity (University of Bristol)",University of Bristol,grid.5337.2,United Kingdom,,13,13,,,121,https://doi.org/10.1177/13623613211014995,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139149054,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,Yes,https://osf.io/ykghx,Observational ,

One mechanistic account of these comorbidities is that ASD is characterized by impaired emotion regulation (ER) that results in deficits modulating emotional responses. We assessed neural activation during cognitive reappraisal of faces in high functioning adults with ASD. Groups did not differ in looking time, pupilometry, or subjective ratings of faces during reappraisal. However, instructions to increase positive and negative emotional responses resulted in less increase in nucleus accumbens and amygdala activations (respectively) in the ASD group, and both regulation instructions resulted in less change in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex activation in the ASD group. Results suggest a potential mechanistic account of impaired ER in ASD.","We thank the clinicians at Chapel Hill Division TEACCH for consultation on the cognitive reappraisal training instructions.

Mean acoustic startle response magnitudes in response to 65-105 dB stimuli, in increments of 10 dB, were analyzed in children with autism spectrum disorders and with typical development. Average peak startle latency was also examined. We examined the relationship of these acoustic startle response measures to parent-reported behavioral sensory processing patterns in everyday situations, assessed using the Sensory Profile for all participants. Low-threshold scores on the Sensory Profile auditory section were related to acoustic startle response magnitudes at 75 and 85 dB, but not to the lower intensities of 65 dB. The peak startle latency and acoustic startle response magnitudes at low-stimuli intensities of 65 and 75 dB were significantly related to the low-threshold quadrants (sensory sensitivity and sensation avoiding) scores and to the high-threshold quadrant of sensation seeking.

A total of 32 studies were included; most focused on younger male participants. Although evidence was lacking for most types of intervention, employment programmes and social skills training were found to be effective for more proximal outcomes such as social skills. Evidence that any intervention improves mental health or well-being was very limited. Most interventions focused on mitigating specific deficits, rather than on providing broader support.

SHANK3 is critical for synaptic function, and preclinical and clinical studies suggest that insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) can reverse a range of deficits in PMS. IGF-1 release is stimulated by growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland, and this study sought to assess the feasibility of increasing IGF-1 levels through recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) treatment, in addition to establishing safety and exploring efficacy of rhGH in children with PMS.MethodsrhGH was administered once daily for 12 weeks to six children with PMS using an open-label design. IGF-1 levels, safety, and efficacy assessments were measured every 4 weeks throughout the study.ResultsrhGH administration increased levels of IGF-1 by at least 2 standard deviations and was well tolerated without serious adverse events. rhGH treatment was also associated with clinical improvement in social withdrawal, hyperactivity, and sensory symptoms.LimitationsResults should be interpreted with caution given the small sample size and lack of a placebo control.ConclusionsOverall, findings are promising and indicate the need for larger studies with rhGH in PMS.Trial registration NCT04003207.

Two-thirds of those surveyed reported some type of distress related to the pandemic (i.e. difficulty coping or negative impact on emotional and mental health). While there were no changes in depressive and anxiety symptoms from prior to COVID-19 to 10 week later in the group as a whole, self-reported distress predicted increases in both anxiety and depression across the two timepoints. Furthermore, adults with higher levels of anxiety prior to the pandemic were more likely to report distress, and women were more likely to report a negative impact of the pandemic on their emotional and mental health. Findings highlight the importance of monitoring with adults with autism spectrum disorder to assess their need for mental health support, and providing ongoing support to those who already experience anxiety even before the pandemic.","The authors are grateful to all of the families in SPARK, the SPARK clinical sites and SPARK staff.

We analyzed the data of 101 autistic and 145 non-autistic adults, without intellectual deficiency, on two flexibility tasks performed online. The first task involved unpredictable and non-explicit shifts of complex socio-emotional stimuli, whereas the second task involved predictable and explicit shifts of character stimuli. Considering the discrepancies between laboratory results and the real-life flexibility-related challenges faced by autistic individuals, we need to determine which factor could be of particular importance in flexibility difficulties. We point out that the switch cost (i.e. the difference between shift and non-shift condition) was larger for autistic than for non-autistic participants on the complex flexibility task with unpredictable and non-explicit shifts of socio-emotional stimuli, whereas this was not the case when shifts were predictable, explicit and involved less complex stimuli. We also highlight sex differences, suggesting that autistic females have better social skills than autistic males and that they also have a specific cognitive profile, which could contribute to social camouflaging. The findings of this work help us understand which factors could influence flexibility difficulties in autism and are important for designing future studies. They also add to the literature on sex differences in autism which underpin better social skills, executive function, and camouflaging in autistic females.","The authors thank all participants for their participation in this study.

Based upon work in genetically modified mice, 5-HT is known to influence several aspects of brain development, but systematic neuroimaging studies have not previously been reported. In particular, the 5-HT transporter (serotonin transporter, SERT; 5-HTT) gene, Slc6a4, has been extensively studied.MethodsUsing a 7-T MRI and deformation-based morphometry, we assessed neuroanatomical differences in an Slc6a4 knockout mouse on a C57BL/6 genetic background, along with an Slc6a4 Ala56 knockin mouse on two different genetic backgrounds (129S and C57BL/6).ResultsIndividually (same sex, same background, same genotype), the only differences found were in the female Slc6a4 knockout mouse; all the others had no significant differences. However, an analysis of variance across the whole study sample revealed a significant effect of Slc6a4 on the amygdala, thalamus, dorsal raphe nucleus, and lateral and frontal cortices.ConclusionsThis work shows that an increase or decrease in SERT function has a significant effect on the neuroanatomy in 5-HT relevant regions, particularly the raphe nuclei. Notably, the Slc6a4 Ala56 knockin alone appears to have an insignificant, but suggestive, effect compared to the KO, which is consistent with Slc6a4 function. Despite the small number of 5-HT neurons and their localization to the brainstem, it is clear that 5-HT plays an important role in neuroanatomical organization.",We thank the Allen Institute for Brain Science for providing connectivity (©2011 Allen Institute for Brain Science.

To date, the relationship between sensory atypicalities in dyads of children with ASD and their parents has not been investigated. Exploring these relationships can contribute to an understanding of how phenotypic profiles may be inherited, and the extent to which familial factors might contribute towards children's sensory profiles and constitute an aspect of the broader autism phenotype (BAP). Parents of 44 children with ASD and 30 typically developing (TD) children, aged between 3 and 14 years, participated. Information about children's sensory experiences was collected through parent report using the Sensory Profile questionnaire. Information about parental sensory experiences was collected via self-report using the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile. Parents of children with ASD had significantly higher scores than parents of TD children in relation to low registration, over responsivity, and taste/smell sensory processing. Similar levels of agreement were obtained within ASD and TD parent-child dyads on a number of sensory atypicalities; nevertheless significant correlations were found between parents and children in ASD families but not TD dyads for sensation avoiding and auditory, visual, and vestibular sensory processing. The findings suggest that there are similarities in sensory processing profiles between parents and their children in both ASD and TD dyads. Familial sensory processing factors are likely to contribute towards the BAP. Further work is needed to explore genetic and environmental influences on the developmental pathways of the sensory atypicalities in ASD.

Seventy-five parents completed an online composite questionnaire consisting of the symptoms of SM and ASD, anxiety and sensory measures. The results found the SM + ASD group showed significantly higher levels of social anxiety and sensory avoidance compared to the SM only group. However, a simple mediation model revealed sensory avoidance to be a mediator of this relationship between the diagnosis and social anxiety.. Therefore, higher levels of sensory avoidance may help to differentiate social anxiety between the groups and may also be a sign of ASD in children with SM who have and/or are yet to receive an ASD diagnosis.",,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",,29/07/2022,2022,29/07/2022,29/07/2022,,,01-Oct,Closed,Article,"Ludlow, Amanda K.; Osborne, Clarissa; Keville, Saskia","Ludlow, Amanda K.

Based on several converging lines of preclinical and clinical evidence supporting the use of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) in PMS, this study aims to follow-up a previous pilot study with IGF-1 to further evaluate this novel therapeutic for core symptoms of ASD in children with PMS.MethodsTen children aged 5–9 with PMS were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive IGF-1 or placebo (saline) using a 12-week, double-blind, crossover design. Efficacy was assessed using the primary outcome of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist—Social Withdrawal (ABC-SW) subscale as well as secondary outcome measures reflecting core symptoms of ASD. To increase power and sample size, we jointly analyzed the effect of IGF-1 reported here together with results from our previous controlled trail of IGF-1 in children with PMS (combined N = 19).ResultsResults on the ABC-SW did not reach statistical significance, however significant improvements in sensory reactivity symptoms were observed. In our pooled analyses, IGF-1 treatment also led to significant improvements in repetitive behaviors and hyperactivity. There were no other statistically significant effects seen across other clinical outcome measures. IGF-1 was well tolerated and there were no serious adverse events.LimitationsThe small sample size and expectancy bias due to relying on parent reported outcome measures may contribute to limitations in interpreting results.ConclusionIGF-1 is efficacious in improving sensory reactivity symptoms, repetitive behaviors, and hyperactivity  in children with PMS.Trial registration NCT01525901.",We would like to express our gratitude to the many families that work closely with us to better understand neurodevelopmental disability and a special thanks to the Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation for their support in recruitment and to the children and families who participated in this trial.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Child; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosome Disorders; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22; Humans; Insulin-Like Growth Factor I; Pilot Projects",08/04/2022,2022,08/04/2022,2022-12,13,1,17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kolevzon, A.; Breen, M.

This is referred to as emotional self-awareness. It is important to study emotional self-awareness as people who are more able to understand their own emotions, whether they are autistic or not, are more able to respond to them appropriately, as well as to identify them in other people. It has not yet been confirmed whether autistic people have difficulties with emotional self-awareness, or if any reported difficulties are actually due to the way in which emotional self-awareness is measured in autistic people. If these difficulties do exist, it is also not known when these difficulties emerge. In this research, we reviewed 47 existing studies that measured emotional self-awareness in autistic and non-autistic adults and children. We also compared studies that measured emotional self-awareness in different ways. We found that autistic adults did seem to have poorer emotional self-awareness compared to their neurotypical peers. However, this was not the case with autistic children of age 12 years and below. Instead, differences in emotional self-awareness only seemed to emerge during adolescence. Moreover, these difficulties seemed to increase with age. These results suggest that difficulties with emotional self-awareness may not be inherent in autism. Instead, they may emerge alongside the greater social and mental health difficulties that are experienced by many autistic people during adolescence. We therefore suggest that it is important to find out more about, and subsequently support, the emotional self-awareness difficulties that autistic adolescents may encounter.",We would like to sincerely thank all the authors who shared their data with us.

This network meta-analysis investigated pharmacological and dietary-supplement treatments for ASD.MethodsWe searched for randomized-controlled-trials (RCTs) with a minimum duration of seven days in ClinicalTrials.gov, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO, WHO-ICTRP (from inception up to July 8, 2018), CENTRAL and PubMed (up to November 3, 2021). The co-primary outcomes were core symptoms (social-communication difficulties-SCD, repetitive behaviors-RB, overall core symptoms-OCS) measured by validated scales and standardized-mean-differences (SMDs). Associated symptoms, e.g., irritability/aggression and attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) symptoms, dropouts and important side-effects, were investigated as secondary outcomes. Studies in children/adolescents and adults were analyzed separately in random-effects pairwise and network meta-analyses.ResultsWe analyzed data for 41 drugs and 17 dietary-supplements, from 125 RCTs (n = 7450 participants) in children/adolescents and 18 RCTs (n = 1104) in adults. The following medications could improve at least one core symptom domain in comparison with placebo: aripiprazole (k = 6 studies in analysis, SCD: SMD = 0.27 95% CI [0.09, 0.44], RB: 0.48 [0.26, 0.70]), atomoxetine (k = 3, RB:0.49 [0.18, 0.80]), bumetanide (k = 4, RB: 0.35 [0.09, 0.62], OCS: 0.61 [0.31, 0.91]), and risperidone (k = 4, SCM: 0.31 [0.06, 0.55], RB: 0.60 [0.29, 0.90]; k = 3, OCS: 1.18 [0.75, 1.61]) in children/adolescents; fluoxetine (k = 1, RB: 1.20 [0.45, 1.96]), fluvoxamine (k = 1, RB: 1.04 [0.27, 1.81]), oxytocin (k = 6, RB:0.41 [0.16, 0.66]) and risperidone (k = 1, RB: 0.97 [0.21,1.74]) in adults. There were some indications of improvement by carnosine, haloperidol, folinic acid, guanfacine, omega-3-fatty-acids, probiotics, sulforaphane, tideglusib and valproate, yet imprecise and not robust. Confidence in these estimates was very low or low, except moderate for oxytocin. Medications differed substantially in improving associated symptoms, and in their side-effect profiles.LimitationsMost of the studies were inadequately powered (sample sizes of 20–80 participants), with short duration (8–13 weeks), and about a third focused on associated symptoms. Networks were mainly star-shaped, and there were indications of reporting bias. There was no optimal rating scale measuring change in core symptoms.ConclusionsSome medications could improve core symptoms, although this could be likely secondary to the improvement of associated symptoms. Evidence on their efficacy and safety is preliminary; therefore, routine prescription of medications for the core symptoms cannot be recommended.Trial registration PROSPERO-ID CRD42019125317.","We would like to thank Farhad Shokraneh, former information specialist of the Cochrane Schizophrenia Group, who conducted the first search in electronic databases, Dr. Yikang Zhu for the translation of a Chinese study and Prof. Toshi Furukawa for the translation of a Japanese study.

In our work, we present a narrative review, which includes 20 observational studies that provide data on the blood levels of vitamin D, folate, or fatty acids of children diagnosed with ASD (Autism Spectrum Disorder—AG group), and of a control group (children without this disorder—CG group). The main characteristics and results are presented in a summary table. Of the 20 above-mentioned studies, a meta-analysis of vitamin D and folate levels was carried out in 14 of them, with a total of 2269 children (AG = 1159, CG = 1110). Vitamin D levels were lower in AG compared to CG: SMD, 95% CI = − 0.83 [− 1.15, − 0.50]. In terms of folate levels, a total of 299 children (AG = 148, CG = 151) were analyzed, finding no significant differences with the control group: SMD, 95% CI = − 0.16 [− 0.63, 0.32]. Only one study that provided data on fatty acids in children with ASD was included in the review although it was not possible to include it in the meta-analysis. We conclude that the nutritional status (vitamin and fatty acid levels) of patients diagnosed with ASD should be taken into account, as correct adjustment of these levels—may produce an improvement in the course of the disease and could also reduce the risk of its development.",We would like to thank the University of Murcia for its collaboration during the performance of this study.,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Fatty Acids; Folic Acid; Humans; Vitamin D; Vitamins,03/11/2021,2021,03/11/2021,2022-11,52,11,4708-4721,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Gallardo-Carrasco, Maria Carmen; Jiménez-Barbero, José Antonio; Bravo-Pastor, María del Mar; Martin-Castillo, David; Sánchez-Muñoz, María","Gallardo-Carrasco, Maria Carmen (“Los Arcos” Mental Health Center, Paraje Torre Octavio, 54, PC: 30739, Pozo Aledo, Murcia, Spain); Jiménez-Barbero, José Antonio (Department of Nursing, University of Murcia, Espinardo Campus, Building 23, PC: 30100, Murcia, Spain); Bravo-Pastor, María del Mar (Nursing Department, University School of Nursing of Cartagena, University of Murcia,, Campus de Cartagena, Paseo Alfonso XIII, 61, PC: 30203, Cartagena, Murcia, Spain); Martin-Castillo, David (Department of Nursing, University of Murcia, Espinardo Campus, Building 23, PC: 30100, Murcia, Spain); Sánchez-Muñoz, María (“Los Arcos” Mental Health Center, Paraje Torre Octavio, 54, PC: 30739, Pozo Aledo, Murcia, Spain)","Jiménez-Barbero, José Antonio (University of Murcia)","Gallardo-Carrasco, Maria Carmen (); Jiménez-Barbero, José Antonio (University of Murcia); Bravo-Pastor, María del Mar (University of Murcia); Martin-Castillo, David (University of Murcia); Sánchez-Muñoz, María ()",University of Murcia,grid.10586.3a,Spain,,1,1,,,6,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10803-021-05335-8.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1142376837,39 Education; 42 Health Sciences; 52 Psychology,,Yes,,Systematic Review,"Link in paper is dead, cannot find by ID or title"

This difference might indicate sex-specific alterations of brain networks involved in autism symptom domains, especially within cortico-striatal and sensory integration networks. This study used a well-controlled twin design to examine sex differences in brain anatomy in relation to repetitive behaviors.MethodsIn 75 twin pairs (n = 150, 62 females, 88 males) enriched for autism spectrum disorder (n = 32), and other neurodevelopmental disorders (n = 32), we explored the association of restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests—operationalized by the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (C domain) and the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (Restricted Interests and Repetitive Behavior subscale)—with cortical volume, surface area and thickness of neocortical, sub-cortical, and cerebellar networks.ResultsCo-twin control analyses revealed within-pair associations between RRBI symptoms and increased thickness of the right intraparietal sulcus and reduced volume of the right orbital gyrus in females only, even though the mean number of RRBIs did not differ between the sexes. In a sub-sample of ASD-discordant pairs, increased thickness in association with RRBIs was found exclusively in females in the orbitofrontal regions, superior frontal gyrus, and intraparietal sulcus, while in males RRBIs tended to be associated with increased volume of the bilateral pallidum.LimitationsHowever, due to a small sample size and the small difference in RRBI symptoms within pairs, the results of this exploratory study need to be interpreted with caution.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that structural alterations of fronto-parietal networks in association with RRBIs are found mostly in females, while striatal networks are more affected in males. These results endorse the importance of investigating sex differences in the neurobiology of autism symptoms, and indicate different etiological pathways underlying restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests in females and males.","Firstly, we are grateful for the participation, time, patience, and cooperation of our twins and their parents in the RATSS project and especially during the scanning sessions.

181,1615,pub.1151581220,10.1002/aur.2826,36196666,,,Examining the relationship between cognitive inflexibility and internalizing and externalizing symptoms in autistic children and adolescents: A systematic review and meta‐analysis,"Compared to neurotypical peers, autistic adolescents show greater cognitive inflexibility (CI) which manifests at the behavioral and cognitive level and potentially increases vulnerability for the development of internalizing (INT) and externalizing (EXT) symptoms. This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the association between CI and INT/EXT in autistic adolescents. PubMed, EMBASE, MEDLINE, PsycINFO and Web of Science databases were searched to identify relevant studies until April 2022 (PROSPERO protocol: CRD42021277294). Systematic review included 21 studies (n = 1608) of CI and INT, and 15 studies (n = 1115) of CI and EXT. A pooled effect size using Pearson's correlation between CI and INT/EXT was calculated and the moderating effects of age, sex, IQ and study quality were investigated using meta-regressions. Sensitivity analyses were completed to investigate the impact of measure variance for CI and co-occurring ADHD on the overall effects. Greater CI is associated with increased INT (nine studies; n = 833; r = 0.39 (moderate effect), 95% confidence interval [0.32, 0.46]) and EXT (six studies; n = 295; r = 0.48 (large effect), 95% confidence interval [0.38, 0.58]). Results withheld when only using parental reports of CI and excluding autistic adolescents with co-occurring ADHD. Increased CI may be a transdiagnostic vulnerability factor that can increase autistic adolescents' rigid or perseverative patterns of unhelpful cognition and behaviors and reduce their ability to access psychological interventions. Addressing CI may improve autistic children and adolescents' engagement with psychological therapy for co-occurring mental health difficulties. LAY SUMMARY: This systematic review and meta-analysis explored the relationship between cognitive inflexibility (CI) and symptoms of anxiety, depression and behavioral difficulties in autistic children and adolescents. CI refers to increased rigidity and perseveration in thinking and behavior and was found to be associated with increased mental health symptoms in autistic adolescents. Addressing and targeting individual differences in CI may improve autistic children and adolescents' engagement with psychological therapy for co-occurring mental health difficulties.",The authors thank all of the researchers who participated in the studies involved in the current article.,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",,05/10/2022,2022,05/10/2022,05/10/2022,,,,Closed,Article,"Lei, Jiedi; Charman, Tony; Leigh, Eleanor; Russell, Ailsa; Mohamed, Zameer; Hollocks, Matthew J.","Lei, Jiedi (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK); Charman, Tony (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK); Leigh, Eleanor (Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK); Russell, Ailsa (Centre for Applied Autism Research, Department of Psychology, University of Bath, Bath, UK); Mohamed, Zameer (Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology & Neuroscience, King's College London, London, UK; South London and Maudsley NHS Trust, London, UK); Hollocks, Matthew J.

Our aim was to determine the prevalence and type of atypical sensory processing in children with ASD and investigate its impact on their adaptive functioning and maladaptive behaviors. We studied a subsample of 197 children rigorously diagnosed with ASD from the ELENA cohort. Children were divided into atypical and typical sensory processing groups and several independent variables were compared, including adaptive functioning and maladaptive behaviors. Overall, 86.8% of the children had at least one atypical sensory pattern and all sensory modalities were disturbed. Atypical sensory processing explained a significant part of the variance of behavioral problems.","We thank the participating families, and our talented staff (Myriam Soussana, Julie Loubersac, Ela Miniarikova, Flore Couty and Lee Audras-Torrent).

185,1585,pub.1141029678,10.1002/aur.2608,34505741,,,A biomarker‐based study of prenatal smoking exposure and autism in a Finnish national birth cohort,"Maternal exposure to tobacco smoke during pregnancy is a common and persistent exposure linked to adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. However, previous studies provide mixed evidence regarding the relationship between prenatal smoking and offspring autism. This study used cotinine level, a biomarker for nicotine, to investigate the relationship between prenatal smoking and autism. The authors conducted a population-based case-control study nested in a national cohort of all births in Finland from 1987 to 2005. Cases diagnosed with childhood autism (ICD-10/9 code F84.0/299.0) through 2007 were identified using data from linked national registers. Each case was matched with a control on date of birth (±30 days), sex, and place of birth (N = 962 pairs). Maternal serum cotinine levels were prospectively measured in first- to early second-trimester serum samples archived in a national biobank using a quantitative immunoassay. Data were analyzed using conditional logistic regression. Prenatal maternal levels of serum cotinine were not associated with the odds of autism, whether cotinine was classified continuously, by deciles, or using previously defined categories corresponding to probable maternal smoking status. After adjusting for maternal age, paternal age, previous births, and any history of parental psychiatric disorder, the odds ratio for categorical high versus low cotinine, using a 3-level exposure variable, was 0.98 (95% CI = 0.76, 1.26; p = 0.88). In conclusion, this national birth cohort-based study does not provide evidence for an association between maternal cotinine, a biomarker of maternal smoking, and risk of autism. LAY SUMMARY: This study explored whether prenatal exposure to tobacco smoke in mothers is related to the diagnosis of autism in their children, by measuring the levels of cotinine, a biomarker for tobacco exposure, in stored serum samples drawn from mothers during pregnancy. The levels of cotinine in the mothers of children diagnosed with autism were similar to those in the mothers of control children of similar age and gender distribution.","This work was supported by a grant from the National Institute of Environmental Health Sciences (5R01ES028125; PI, Brown).

As sensory problems are highly prevalent in individuals with ASD and their siblings, and the occurrence of affective disorders is elevated in parents of children with ASD, investigating sensory symptoms in parents is important both from clinical and theoretical standpoints.Fifty mothers of children and adolescents with ASD completed the Adolescent and Adult Sensory Profile (AASP). The AASP is a norm-referenced questionnaire that provides scores for four types of responses to sensory stimuli (sensory quadrants): hypo-sensitivity, hyper-sensitivity, sensation seeking, and sensory avoiding.FindingsMothers’ scores were compared with AASP norms. Ninety eight percent of mothers had sensory scores at least one standard deviation (SD) above the normative mean and 44% were two or more SDs above the mean for at least one sensory quadrant.ConclusionsThis study provides the first evidence for sensory atypicality in parents of children with ASD. Further research is needed to elucidate the contribution of genetic and environmental influences on the expression of sensory problems in ASD.","This research was supported by PhD funding to MU and SL from the Wales Office of Research and Development for Health and Social Care, National Institute for Social Care and Health Research and the School of Psychology, Cardiff University.

This study examined the neural effects of social cognitive skills groups during functional MRI (fMRI) tasks of irony comprehension and eye gaze processing in school-aged children with ASD. Verbally fluent children (ages 8-11) were randomized to social cognitive skills groups or facilitated play comparison groups. Behavioral assessments and fMRI scans were obtained at baseline and endpoint (12 weeks). During fMRI, children completed two separate tasks to engage social cognition circuitry: comprehension of potentially ironic scenarios (n = 34) and viewing emotionally expressive faces with direct or averted gaze (n = 24). Whole-brain analyses were conducted to examine neural changes following treatment. Regression analyses were also conducted to explore the relationship between neural and behavioral changes. When comparing the two groups directly, the social cognitive skills group showed greater increases in activity in the medial prefrontal cortex (mPFC), implicated in theory of mind, relative to the comparison group for both irony comprehension and gaze processing tasks. Increased mPFC activity during the irony task was associated with improvement in social functioning on the Social Responsiveness Scale across both groups. Findings indicate that social cognitive skills interventions may increase activity in regions associated with social cognition and mentalizing abilities. LAY SUMMARY: Social skills groups are a common intervention for school-aged children with ASD. However, few studies have examined the neural response to social skills groups in school-aged children with ASD. Here, we report on a study evaluating neural outcomes from an empirically supported social cognitive skills training curriculum using fMRI. This study seeks to understand the effects of targeting emotion recognition and theory of mind on the brain circuitry involved in social cognition in verbally fluent children ages 8-11. Results indicate increased neural activity in the mPFC, a region considered to be a central hub of the ""social brain,"" in children randomized to social cognitive skills groups relative to a comparison group that received a high-quality, child-directed play approach. In addition, increased activation in the mPFC during an irony comprehension task was associated with gains in social functioning across both groups from pre- to post-treatment. This is the first fMRI study of social skills treatment outcomes following a randomized trial with an active treatment condition in school-aged children with ASD.","We would like to thank Ms. Sarah Soffes and Ms. Sarah Teitelbaum for study coordination, Dr. Mirella Dapretto for providing the gaze task, and Dr. Jin Fan for his assistance with Monte Carlo simulations.

This paper presents data on perception of complex tones and speech pitch in adult participants with high-functioning ASD and typical development, and compares these with pre-existing data using the same paradigm with groups of children and adolescents with and without ASD. As perceptual processing abnormalities are likely to influence behavioural performance, regression analyses were carried out on the adult data set. The findings revealed markedly different pitch discrimination trajectories and language correlates across diagnostic groups. While pitch discrimination increased with age and correlated with receptive vocabulary in groups without ASD, it was enhanced in childhood and stable across development in ASD. Pitch discrimination scores did not correlate with receptive vocabulary scores in the ASD group and for adults with ASD superior pitch perception was associated with sensory atypicalities and diagnostic measures of symptom severity. We conclude that the development of pitch discrimination, and its associated mechanisms markedly distinguish those with and without ASD.",We would like to thank all of our participants with and without ASD.

In this study, we searched for all children with autism spectrum disorder attending schools in the Western Cape province of South Africa and compared our findings with the profile of people living in the province. We found fewer children with autism spectrum disorder in schools than expected (0.08%) and co-occurring conditions (intellectual disability = 22.2%, attention-deficit/hyperactivity disorder = 2.6% and epilepsy = 0.7%) were reported at lower rates. More children were from White racial groups and from English-speaking homes compared with the Western Cape population demographics. Most of the children (89%) attended schools for children with Special Educational Needs and only 10% were in Ordinary/Mainstream schools.

This reflects the lack of large-scale studies demonstrating its prominence to advocate for change. We examined the prevalence of motor difficulties at the time of diagnosis in a large sample of children with autism utilizing standardized assessment, and the relationship between motor difficulties, core autism symptomology, and other prominent clinical features. Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were administered to children from the Western Australian Register for Autism Spectrum Disorders aged ≤6 years (N = 2,084; 81.2% males, 18.8% females). Prevalence of motor difficulties was quantified based on scores from the motor domain of the Vineland and then compared to other domains of functioning within the Vineland (communication, daily living, and socialization), the DSM criteria, intellectual level, age, and gender. Scores on the Vineland indicated that 35.4% of the sample met criteria for motor difficulties (standard score <70), a rate almost as common as intellectual impairment (37.7%). Motor difficulties were reported by diagnosing clinicians in only 1.34% of cases. Motor difficulties were common in those cases meeting diagnostic criteria for impairments in nonverbal behavior and the presence of restricted and repetitive behaviors. The prevalence of motor difficulties also increased with increasing age of diagnosis (P < 0.001). Findings from the present study highlight the need for further consideration of motor difficulties as a distinct specifier within the diagnostic criteria for ASD.

The aim of this study was to explore how these changes impacted on children on the autism spectrum. As part of an online survey, parents (n = 180) of school-aged children (9.3–16.5 years) on the autism spectrum in Australia were asked an open-ended question on how the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted on their child’s education experience. Nearly half (48%) of the parents reported only negative impacts, 26% only positive impacts, 12% a mix of positive and negative impacts, and 9% little or no impact. Parents identified that school restrictions impacted on more than their child’s learning. These findings highlight areas to consider when supporting autism-friendly learning.","The authors are grateful to the children with autism and their families for giving their time to support this research study.

The population trial included 545 temperamentally inhibited pre-schoolers recruited across eight economically diverse areas of Melbourne, Australia. Within this sample, 26 parents reported that their child had received an ASD diagnosis. Trial measures included baseline inhibited temperament and developmental problems, post-intervention feedback on the programme, and caregiver-reported child mental health outcomes (anxiety diagnoses and internalising symptoms) at 1- and 2-year follow-up. Sample retention for the children with ASD over 2 years was strong (92%). At follow-up, fewer intervention than control children with ASD had anxiety disorders after 1 year (% (n): 25 (3) vs. 77 (10), P = .028) and separation anxiety symptoms after 2 years (M (SD): 4.22 (2.68) vs. 9.38 (5.91), P = .017). Similar effects favouring the intervention group were apparent across other child emotional outcome measures but without statistical significance in this small sample. Parents of the children with ASD reported that Cool Little Kids was ""quite useful"" in relation to their child's anxiety but also gave feedback that they would appreciate some tailoring of programme content to the context of ASD. These pilot findings suggest Cool Little Kids may be helpful for reducing comorbid anxiety in pre-schoolers with ASD. Further research is warranted to develop an ASD-specific adaptation which can be trialled with a larger sample of children with confirmed ASD diagnosis.

Use of automated facial expression detection technology enables accurate and efficient tracking of facial expressions that has potential to identify individual response differences.MethodsChildren and adults with ASD (N = 124) and typically developing (TD, N = 41) were shown short clips of “funny videos.” Using automated facial analysis software, we investigated differences between ASD and TD groups and within the ASD group in evidence of facial action unit (AU) activation related to the expression of positive facial expression, in particular, a smile.ResultsIndividuals with ASD on average showed less evidence of facial AUs (AU12, AU6) relating to positive facial expression, compared to the TD group (p < .05, r = − 0.17). Using Gaussian mixture model for clustering, we identified two distinct distributions within the ASD group, which were then compared to the TD group. One subgroup (n = 35), termed “over-responsive,” expressed more intense positive facial expressions in response to the videos than the TD group (p < .001, r = 0.31). The second subgroup (n = 89), (“under-responsive”), displayed fewer, less intense positive facial expressions in response to videos than the TD group (p < .001; r = − 0.36). The over-responsive subgroup differed from the under-responsive subgroup in age and caregiver-reported impulsivity (p < .05, r = 0.21). Reduced expression in the under-responsive, but not the over-responsive group, was related to caregiver-reported social withdrawal (p < .01, r = − 0.3).LimitationsThis exploratory study does not account for multiple comparisons, and future work will have to ascertain the strength and reproducibility of all results. Reduced displays of positive facial expressions do not mean individuals with ASD do not experience positive emotions.ConclusionsIndividuals with ASD differed from the TD group in their facial expressions of positive emotion in response to “funny videos.” Identification of subgroups based on response may help in parsing heterogeneity in ASD and enable targeting of treatment based on subtypes.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02299700.

However, previous results on the efficacy of repeated administrations of oxytocin are controversial. Recently, we reported time-course changes in the efficacy of the neuropeptide underlying the controversial effects of repeated administration; however, the underlying mechanisms remained unknown.MethodsThe current study explored metabolites representing the molecular mechanisms of oxytocin’s efficacy using high-throughput metabolomics analysis on plasma collected before and after 6-week repeated intranasal administration of oxytocin (48 IU/day) or placebo in adult males with ASD (N = 106) who participated in a multi-center, parallel-group, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized controlled trial.ResultsAmong the 35 metabolites measured, a significant increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was detected in the subjects administered oxytocin compared with those given placebo at a medium effect size (false discovery rate (FDR) corrected P = 0.043, d = 0.74, N = 83). Furthermore, subgroup analyses of the participants displaying a prominent time-course change in oxytocin efficacy revealed a significant effect of oxytocin on N,N-dimethylglycine levels with a large effect size (PFDR = 0.004, d = 1.13, N = 60). The increase in N,N-dimethylglycine was significantly correlated with oxytocin-induced clinical changes, assessed as changes in quantifiable characteristics of autistic facial expression, including both of improvements between baseline and 2 weeks (PFDR = 0.006, r = − 0.485, N = 43) and deteriorations between 2 and 4 weeks (PFDR = 0.032, r = 0.415, N = 37).LimitationsThe metabolites changes caused by oxytocin administration were quantified using peripheral blood and therefore may not directly reflect central nervous system changes.ConclusionOur findings demonstrate an association of N,N-dimethylglycine upregulation with the time-course change in the efficacy of oxytocin on autistic social deficits. Furthermore, the current findings support the involvement of the N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor and neural plasticity to the time-course change in oxytocin’s efficacy.Trial registration: A multi-center, parallel-group, placebo-controlled, double-blind, confirmatory trial of intranasal oxytocin in participants with autism spectrum disorders (the date registered: 30 October 2014; UMIN Clinical Trials Registry: https://upload.umin.ac.jp/cgi-open-bin/ctr_e/ctr_view.cgi?recptno=R000017703) (UMIN000015264).","This work was supported by the Strategic Research Program for Brain Sciences from Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development (JP18dm0107134).

Its potential application in autism spectrum disorder remains to be tested. Here, we demonstrate the feasibility of real-time functional magnetic resonance imaging volitional neurofeedback in targeting social brain regions in autism spectrum disorder. In this clinical trial, autism spectrum disorder patients were enrolled in a program with five training sessions of neurofeedback. Participants were able to control their own brain activity in this social brain region, with positive clinical and neural effects. Larger, controlled, and blinded clinical studies will be required to confirm the benefits.",The authors thank Carlos Ferreira and Sónia Afonso for their technical support.

The relationships between the sensory features and repetitive behaviors in both disorders, and the mechanisms underlying these relationships are not well understood. The aim of this study was to examine the relationships between sensory processing, repetitive behaviors, anxiety, and intolerance of uncertainty in children with ASD and those with WS to better understand the complexity of psychopathology in these disorders. Parents of 19 children with ASD and 16 children with WS, aged between 4 and 9 years, were asked to complete questionnaires assessing their children's sensory experiences, anxiety symptoms, severity and frequency of repetitive behaviors, and level of intolerance of uncertainty. Serial mediation analysis was performed. Direct significant relationships between sensory features and repetitive behaviors were found only for the ASD group. The relationship between sensory processing difficulties and repetitive behaviors was mediated via intolerance of uncertainty in WS. The findings support the value of considering the complexity of the mechanisms underlying the relationship between sensory processing and repetitive behaviors across neurodevelopmental disorders and the mechanisms underlying these aspects of psychopathology in these groups. Understanding these relationships will shed light on some of the most challenging and intractable characteristics of both conditions and inform suitable interventions to improve quality of life for individuals with either ASD or WS.

Children with autism aged 8–13 years (n = 141) were randomized over a waitlist control or treatment condition. Both having more siblings, as well as having an older sibling were related to better outcomes on measures of ToM-related behavior and social cognition, but not ToM knowledge or autistic features in general. The finding that these associations were limited to practical skills addressed in the intervention, seems to indicate that having more siblings and having an older sibling provides enhanced opportunities for children with autism to practice taught skills in the home environment.","Sander Begeer received Research Grants ZonMW (The Netherlands) Grant Number 70-72900-98-14050.

Studies using absolute strength have found reduced connectivity, while those using relative strength––a measure of system topology––reveal mostly enhanced connectivity. We hypothesized that mixed findings may be driven by the metric of functional connectivity.MethodsResting-state echo planar 3 T functional magnetic resonance imaging scans were acquired on a Siemens Verio Scanner from 6 to 17-year-old youth with ASD (n = 81) and a matched typically developing control group (n = 82). All functional time series data were preprocessed using a confound regression procedure that has been previously validated in large-scale developmental datasets. It has also been shown to be highly effective at reducing the influence of motion artifact on connectivity data. We extracted time series data from a 333-node parcellation scheme, which was previously mapped to 13 functional systems. A Pearson’s correlation was calculated and transformed to Fisher’s z between every pair of nodes to create a weighted 333 × 333 adjacency matrix. Mean absolute functional connectivity strength was the mean Fisher’s z of the matrix. Relative functional connectivity was corrected for individual differences in mean absolute functional connectivity (i.e., each connection in the matrix was divided by their mean z), and functional connectivity was evaluated within and across each of the functional networks in the parcellation scheme.ResultsAbsolute functional connectivity strength was lower in ASD, and lower functional connectivity was correlated with greater ASD symptom severity. Relative functional connectivity was higher for the ASD group in the ventral attention and retrosplenial-temporal systems, with lower cross-system functional connectivity between the ventral attention and somatomotor-mouth systems. Functional connectivity within the ventral attention and retro-splenial systems correlated significantly with ASD symptom severity.ConclusionsWithin a context of globally weaker functional connectivity, youth with ASD have an atypical topology of brain systems that support social perception and communication. This study clarifies the mixed results reported previously and demonstrates that the functional connectivity metric influences the observed direction of functional connectivity differences for individuals with ASD.",We would like to thank the youth and family members who gave their time and energy to participate in this study.

Each case was matched to four controls by gender, date of birth, place of birth, and residence in Finland. Epilepsy was associated with ASD regardless of the subgroup after adjusting for covariates. The associations were stronger among cases with intellectual disability, especially among females. Epilepsy’s age at onset was similar between the cases and controls regardless of the ASD subgroup.

This study aimed to analyze trends in ASD diagnosis and intervention in 20 years of data from the Beijing Stars and Rain Education Institute for Autism (SR), the first autism intervention center in mainland China, and from a recent survey of members of the Heart Alliance, an industry association of autism intervention centers in China.MethodsWe analyzed the registration data at the SR from 1993 to 2012 for a total of 2,222 children who had a parent-reported diagnosis of ASD and 612 of ‘autistic tendencies’. Most of the children who were the primary focus of our analyses were age six and under. We also analyzed results of a survey we conducted in 2013 of 100 member centers of the Heart Alliance. Generalized Estimating Equations, multiple linear regression and the Mann-Whitney test were used for data analysis. Statistically significant findings are reported here.ResultsThe number of hospitals where SR children received their diagnosis increased from several in the early 1990s to 276 at present. The proportion of ‘autistic tendencies’ diagnosis increased 2.04-fold from 1998 to 2012 and was higher for children diagnosed at a younger age. The mean age at first diagnosis of ASD or ‘autistic tendencies’ decreased by 0.27 years every decade. A higher level of parental education was statistically significantly associated with an earlier diagnosis of the child. The mean parental age at childbirth increased by about 1.48 years per decade, and the mean maternal age was 1.40 and 2.10 years higher than that in the national population censuses of 2000 and 2010, respectively. At the time of the survey 3,957 children with ASD were being trained at the 100 autism intervention centers. Ninety-seven of these centers opened after the year 2000. Economically underdeveloped regions are still underserved.ConclusionsThis study revealed encouraging trends and remaining challenges in ASD diagnosis and intervention among children at the SR over the past 20 years and the 100 autism intervention centers in China at present.","The authors thank Drs.

Moreover, variable attention abilities in people with ASD, ranging from good control to periods of high distractibility, may be related to atypical sensory reactivity. This study used auditory event-related potential (ERP) measures to evaluate top-down and bottom-up attentional processes as a function of perceptual load, and examined these factors with respect to sensory reactivity. Twenty-five age and IQ-matched participants (ASD: 22.5 year, SD = 4.1 year; Controls: 22.8 year, SD = 5.1 year) completed the Adolescent/Adult Sensory Profile prior to performing a modified 3-stimulus (target, non-target, and distractor) auditory oddball target detection task EEG was recorded during task completion. ERP analysis assessed early sensory processing (P50, ∼50 ms latency; N100, ∼100 ms latency), cognitive control (N200, ∼200 ms latency), and attentional processing (P3a and P3b, ∼300 ms latency). Behavioral data demonstrates participants with ASD and neurotypical performed similarly on auditory target detection, but diverged on sensory profiles. Target ERP measures associated with top-down control (P3b latency) significantly increased under greater load in controls, but not in participants with ASD. Early ERP responses associated with bottom-up attention (P50 amplitude) were positively correlated to increased sensory sensitivity. Findings suggest specific neural mechanisms for increased perceptual capacity and enhanced bottom-up processing of sensory stimuli in people with autism. Results from participants with ASD are consistent with load theory and enhanced perceptual functioning.

This was done to detect differences in valence processing between 25 subjects with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) and 27 typically developing controls. Valence scaling was abnormal in ASDs. Positive valence induces lower deactivation and abnormally strong activity in ASD in multiple regions. Negative valence increased deactivation in visual areas in subjects with ASDs. The most marked differences between valences focus on fronto-insular and temporal regions. This supports the idea that subjects with ASDs may have difficulty in passive processing of the salience and mirroring of expressions. When the valence scaling of brain activity fails, in contrast to controls, these areas activate and/or deactivate inappropriately during facial stimuli presented dynamically.","We thank the participants and their parents, who graciously gave their time to participate in this study.

Fathers (N = 184) were recruited through autism services across Australia. Participants received messages focusing on five domains: (a) relationships with parenting partner; (b) formal support; (c) father-child interaction; (d) understanding autism; and, (e) coping. Surveys explored parenting stress, co-parenting quality and autism-specific parenting self-efficacy. Eighty-eight percent completed the program, 43.6% completed pre and post surveys. There was significant reduction in parenting stress (p < .01) and increase in autism-specific parenting self-efficacy (p < .01). Effect sizes indicate these may be clinically meaningful. This highly scalable intervention has potential to influence factors that shape and sustain relationships fathers share with their children on the autism spectrum, families and services.","The contribution from staff at Positive Partnerships is acknowledged.

Participants chose between two tasks differing in their relative strength by indicating first their voluntary task choice and then responding to the subsequently presented stimulus. We observed a stronger repetition bias for the harder task in high AQ participants, with no other differences between the two groups.

However, most of the research has focused on the connectivity between cortical regions, and much remains unknown about the developmental changes of functional connectivity between subcortical and cortical areas in autism spectrum disorder. We used the technique of resting-state functional magnetic resonance imaging to explore the developmental characteristics of intrinsic functional connectivity (functional brain connectivity when people are asked not to do anything) between subcortical and cortical regions in individuals with and without autism spectrum disorder aged 6-30 years. We focused on one important subcortical structure called striatum, which has roles in motor, cognitive, and affective processes. We found that cortico-striatal intrinsic functional connectivities showed opposite developmental trajectories in autism spectrum disorder and typically developing individuals, with connectivity increasing with age in autism spectrum disorder and decreasing or constant in typically developing individuals. We also found significant negative behavioral correlations between those atypical cortico-striatal intrinsic functional connectivities and autistic symptoms, such as social-communication deficits, and restricted/repetitive behaviors and interests. Taken together, this work highlights that the atypical development of cortico-subcortical functional connectivity might be largely involved in the neuropathological mechanisms of autism spectrum disorder.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder;

215,1504,pub.1147552685,10.1002/aur.2732,35491911,,,Gray matter volume alteration is associated with insistence on sameness and cognitive flexibility in autistic youth,"Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are hallmark characteristics of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Previous studies suggest that insistence on sameness (IS) characterized as higher-order RRBs may be a promising subgrouping variable for ASD. Cognitive inflexibility may underpin IS behaviors. However, the neuroanatomical correlates of IS and associated cognitive functions remain unclear. We analyzed data from 140 autistic youth and 124 typically developing (TD) youth (mean age = 15.8 years). Autistic youth were stratified by median-split based on three current IS items in the autism diagnostic interview-revised into two groups (high, HIS, n = 70, and low, LIS, n = 70). Differences in cognitive flexibility were assessed by the Cambridge neuropsychological test automated battery (CANTAB). T1-weighted brain structural images were analyzed using voxel-based morphometry (VBM) to identify differences in gray matter (GM) volume among the three groups. GM volume of regions showing group differences was then correlated with cognitive flexibility. The HIS group showed decreased GM volumes in the left supramarginal gyrus compared to the LIS group and increased GM volumes in the vermis VIII and left cerebellar lobule VIII compared to TD individuals. We did not find significant correlations between regional GM volumes and extra-dimensional shift errors. IS may be a unique RRB component and a potentially valuable stratifier of ASD. However, the neurocognitive underpinnings require further clarification. LAY SUMMARY: The present study found parietal, temporal and cerebellar gray matter volume alterations in autistic youth with greater insistence on sameness. The findings suggest that insistence on sameness may be a useful feature to parse the heterogeneity of the autism spectrum yet further research investigating the underlying neurocognitive mechanism is warranted.","This work was supported by grants from the National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC97‐3112‐B‐002‐009, NSC98‐3112‐B‐002‐004, NSC 99‐ 2627‐B‐002‐015, NSC 100‐2627‐B‐002‐014, NSC 101‐2627‐B‐002‐002, NSC 101‐2314‐B‐002‐136‐MY3), National Health Research Institute (NHRI‐EX104‐10404PI, NHRI‐EX105‐10404PI, NHRI‐EX106‐10404PI, NHRI‐EX107‐10404PI, NHRI‐EX108‐10404PI) and National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH101‐S1910), Taiwan and in part by the Department of Medical Imaging and 3 T MRI Lab in National Taiwan University Hospital.

Prior research has established that individuals with autism may be more likely than individuals who are not autistic to have repetitive thoughts. It is possible that persistent thoughts about negative or distressing stimuli may contribute to emotion dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder. This study aimed to identify areas of the brain with evidence of persistent processing of negative information via functional magnetic resonance neuroimaging. We used a task that alternated between emotional processing of personally relevant negative words, neutral words, and a non-emotional task. Criteria were developed to define heightened and persistent emotional processing, and analyses were conducted to identify all brain regions satisfying these criteria. Participants included 25 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder and 23 typically developing adolescents who were similar to the autism spectrum disorder group in IQ, age, and gender ratios. Brain regions identified as having greater and continued processing following negative stimuli in the autism spectrum disorder group as compared with the typically developing group included the salience network and the prefrontal dorsolateral cortex. These areas have been previously implicated in emotion dysregulation outside of autism spectrum disorder. Collectively, brain activity in the identified regions was associated with parent-reported emotion dysregulation in the autism spectrum disorder group. These results help to identify a potential process in the brain associated with emotion dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder. This information may be useful for the development of treatments to decrease emotion dysregulation in autism spectrum disorder.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Cognition; Emotions; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male,28/02/2020,2020,28/02/2020,2020-05,24,4,941-953,All OA; Green,Article,"Mazefsky, Carla A; Collier, Amanda; Golt, Josh; Siegle, Greg J","Mazefsky, Carla A (University of Pittsburgh, USA); Collier, Amanda (University of Pittsburgh, USA); Golt, Josh (University of Pittsburgh, USA; The University of Alabama, USA); Siegle, Greg J (University of Pittsburgh, USA)","Mazefsky, Carla A (University of Pittsburgh)","Mazefsky, Carla A (University of Pittsburgh); Collier, Amanda (University of Pittsburgh); Golt, Josh (University of Pittsburgh; University of Alabama); Siegle, Greg J (University of Pittsburgh)",University of Pittsburgh; University of Alabama,grid.21925.3d; grid.411015.0,United States; United States,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development,5,3,1.09,2.24,2,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7773150,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125174780,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,

Results showed evidence of age by group interactions, suggesting atypicalities in the relation between these measures and age in the ASD group. Additional vertex-based analyses of cortical thickness revealed that specific regions in the left inferior frontal gyrus (BA 44) and left precuneus showed thicker cortex for the ASD group at younger ages only.

More recently research has demonstrated a relationship between autistic traits in the neurotypical (NT) population and increased levels of atypical sensory behaviours. The aim of the present study is to extend previous research by examining specific patterns across aspects of autistic traits and sensory behaviours within both ASD and NT populations. The present study recruited 580 NT adults and 42 high-functioning ASD adults with a confirmed diagnosis to investigate the relationship between specific aspects of autistic traits and sensory processing using the subscales of the autism spectrum quotient (AQ) and adult/adolescent sensory profile (AASP). Results showed a significant relationship between all subscales except for attention to detail and imagination on the AQ and provided the first evidence that the strength and pattern of this relationship is identical between NT and ASD adults. These data also provided support for the broader autism phenotype, uncovering a clear progression of sensory atypicalities in line with an increase in autistic traits, regardless of diagnostic status, which has potential implications for the spectrum approach to ASD and how sensory behaviours across the whole of the neurotypical population are conceptualised.",,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Female; Humans; Male; Phenotype; Sensation Disorders; Young Adult,15/11/2016,2016,15/11/2016,2017-02,47,2,316-327,All OA; Green,Article,"Mayer, Jennifer L.","Mayer, Jennifer L.

Precision medicine approaches aim to overcome this challenge by combining pathophysiologically based treatments with stratification biomarkers that predict which treatment may be most beneficial for particular individuals. However, so far, we have no single validated stratification biomarker for ASD. This may be due to the fact that most research studies primarily have focused on the identification of mean case-control differences, rather than within-group variability, and included small samples that were underpowered for stratification approaches. The EU-AIMS Longitudinal European Autism Project (LEAP) is to date the largest multi-centre, multi-disciplinary observational study worldwide that aims to identify and validate stratification biomarkers for ASD.MethodsLEAP includes 437 children and adults with ASD and 300 individuals with typical development or mild intellectual disability. Using an accelerated longitudinal design, each participant is comprehensively characterised in terms of clinical symptoms, comorbidities, functional outcomes, neurocognitive profile, brain structure and function, biochemical markers and genomics. In addition, 51 twin-pairs (of which 36 had one sibling with ASD) are included to identify genetic and environmental factors in phenotypic variability.ResultsHere, we describe the demographic characteristics of the cohort, planned analytic stratification approaches, criteria and steps to validate candidate stratification markers, pre-registration procedures to increase transparency, standardisation and data robustness across all analyses, and share some ‘lessons learnt’. A clinical characterisation of the cohort is given in the companion paper (Charman et al., accepted).ConclusionWe expect that LEAP will enable us to confirm, reject and refine current hypotheses of neurocognitive/neurobiological abnormalities, identify biologically and clinically meaningful ASD subgroups, and help us map phenotypic heterogeneity to different aetiologies.",We thank all participants and their families for participating in this study.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Biomarkers; Brain; Child; Eye Movement Measurements; Female; Genetic Heterogeneity; Hair; Humans; Individuality; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuroimaging; Patient Selection; Phenotype; Precision Medicine; Saliva; Siblings,23/06/2017,2017,23/06/2017,2017-12,8,1,24,All OA; Gold,Article,"Loth, Eva; Charman, Tony; Mason, Luke; Tillmann, Julian; Jones, Emily J.

The majority of RTT cases are caused by de novo mutations in methyl-CpG-binding protein 2 (MECP2), and several mouse models have been created to further understand the disorder. In the current literature, many studies have focused their analyses on the behavioral abnormalities and cellular and molecular impairments that arise from Mecp2 mutations. However, limited efforts have been placed on understanding how Mecp2 mutations disrupt the neuroanatomy and networks of the brain.MethodsIn this study, we examined the neuroanatomy of male and female mice from the Mecp2tm1Hzo, Mecp2tm1.1Bird/J, and Mecp2tm2Bird/J mouse lines using high-resolution magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) paired with deformation-based morphometry to determine the brain regions susceptible to Mecp2 disruptions.ResultsWe found that many cortical and subcortical regions were reduced in volume within the brains of mutant mice regardless of mutation type, highlighting regions that are susceptible to Mecp2 disruptions. We also found that the volume within these regions correlated with behavioral metrics. Conversely, regions of the cerebellum were differentially affected by the type of mutation, showing an increase in volume in the mutant Mecp2tm1Hzo brain relative to controls and a decrease in the Mecp2tm1.1Bird/J and Mecp2tm2Bird/J lines.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate that the direction and magnitude of the neuroanatomical differences between control and mutant mice carrying Mecp2 mutations are driven by the severity of the mutation and the stage of behavioral impairments.",The authors would like to thank James Ellis for providing the P200 Mecp2tm1Hzo mice for experimentation.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Animals; Behavior, Animal; Cerebellum; Disease Models, Animal; Humans; Methyl-CpG-Binding Protein 2; Mice; Mice, Transgenic; Mutation; Phenotype; Rett Syndrome",26/06/2017,2017,26/06/2017,2017-12,8,1,32,All OA; Gold,Article,"Allemang-Grand, Rylan; Ellegood, Jacob; Spencer Noakes, Leigh; Ruston, Julie; Justice, Monica; Nieman, Brian J.; Lerch, Jason P.","Allemang-Grand, Rylan (Mouse Imaging Centre, 25 Orde Street, M5T 3H7, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Neurosciences and Mental Health, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Ave, M5G 1X8, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Department of Medical Biophysics, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, 101 College Street, Suite 15-701, M5G 1L7, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Ellegood, Jacob (Mouse Imaging Centre, 25 Orde Street, M5T 3H7, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Neurosciences and Mental Health, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Ave, M5G 1X8, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Spencer Noakes, Leigh (Mouse Imaging Centre, 25 Orde Street, M5T 3H7, Toronto, Ontario, Canada; Physiology and Experimental Medicine, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Ave, M5G 1X8, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Ruston, Julie (Genetics and Genome Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Ave, M5G 1X8, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Justice, Monica (Genetics and Genome Biology, Hospital for Sick Children, 555 University Ave, M5G 1X8, Toronto, Ontario, Canada); Nieman, Brian J.

We applied machine learning classifiers to parameters from T1-weighted MRI and DTI data of 58 children with ASD (age 3–6 years) and 48 typically developing controls (TDC). Classification performance reached an accuracy, sensitivity, and specificity of 88.8%, 93.0%, and 83.8%, respectively. The most prominent features were the cortical thickness of the right inferior occipital gyrus, mean diffusivity of the middle cerebellar peduncle, and nodal efficiency of the left posterior cingulate gyrus. Machine learning-based analysis of MRI data was useful in distinguishing low-functioning ASD preschoolers from TDCs. Combination of T1 and DTI improved classification accuracy about 10%, and large-scale multi-modal MRI studies are warranted for external validation.","This research was supported by the National Research Foundation (NRF) funded by the Korean Government (MSIT) (2019M3E5D1A01069345 to J-IK and 2020M3E5D9080787 to B-NK), by the Korea Health Technology R&amp;D Project through the Korea Health Industry Development Institute (KHIDI) and Korea Dementia Research Center (KDRC), funded by the Ministry of Health &amp; Welfare and Ministry of Science and ICT, Republic of Korea (No.HU20C0198 to J-ML), and the Technology Innovation Program (Industrial Strategic Technology Development Program) funded by the Ministry of Trade, Industry, and Energy (20002769 to B-NK, Development of Next Generation Platform for Diagnosis and Therapeutic of Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder and Intellectual Disability based on Big Data).",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",,04/01/2022,2022,04/01/2022,04/01/2022,,,Jan-13,Closed,Article,"Kim, Johanna Inhyang; Bang, Sungkyu; Yang, Jin-Ju; Kwon, Heejin; Jang, Soomin; Roh, Sungwon; Kim, Seok Hyeon; Kim, Mi Jung; Lee, Hyun Ju; Lee, Jong-Min; Kim, Bung-Nyun","Kim, Johanna Inhyang (Department of Psychiatry, Hanyang University Medical Center, 222-1 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Bang, Sungkyu (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Yang, Jin-Ju (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Kwon, Heejin (Department of Psychology, Yonsei University, 50 Yonsei-ro, Seodaemun-gu, 02722, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Jang, Soomin (Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, 03080, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Roh, Sungwon (Department of Psychiatry, Hanyang University Medical Center, 222-1 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Psychiatry, Hanyang University College of Medicine, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Kim, Seok Hyeon (Department of Psychiatry, Hanyang University Medical Center, 222-1 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Psychiatry, Hanyang University College of Medicine, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Seongdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Kim, Mi Jung (Department of Rehabilitation Medicine, Hanyang University College of Medicine, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Lee, Hyun Ju (Department of Pediatrics, Hanyang University College of Medicine, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Lee, Jong-Min (Department of Biomedical Engineering, Hanyang University, 222 Wangsimni-ro, Sungdong-gu, 04763, Seoul, Republic of Korea); Kim, Bung-Nyun (Department of Psychiatry, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehak-ro, Jongno-gu, 03080, Seoul, Republic of Korea; Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Science, Seoul National University College of Medicine, 101 Daehak-no, Chongno-gu, 03080, Seoul, Republic of Korea)","Lee, Jong-Min (Hanyang University); Kim, Bung-Nyun (Seoul National University; Seoul National University)","Kim, Johanna Inhyang (Hanyang University Medical Center); Bang, Sungkyu (Hanyang University); Yang, Jin-Ju (Hanyang University); Kwon, Heejin (Yonsei University); Jang, Soomin (Seoul National University); Roh, Sungwon (Hanyang University Medical Center; Hanyang University); Kim, Seok Hyeon (Hanyang University Medical Center; Hanyang University); Kim, Mi Jung (Hanyang University); Lee, Hyun Ju (Hanyang University); Lee, Jong-Min (Hanyang University); Kim, Bung-Nyun (Seoul National University; Seoul National University)",Hanyang University; Seoul National University; Yonsei University; Hanyang University Medical Center,grid.49606.3d; grid.31501.36; grid.15444.30; grid.411986.3,South Korea; South Korea; South Korea; South Korea,National Research Foundation; National Research Foundation of Korea; Ministry of Health and Welfare,2,2,,,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144401745,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,,No,,,

Little is known about the post-mandate changes in healthcare expenditures.
METHOD: This study utilized 2006-2012 de-identified insurance claims data from the largest insurer in Pennsylvania (PA), where the mandate went into effect in 2009. Healthcare expenditures were defined as the amount the insurer paid for healthcare services and were adjusted to 2012 price level. A mixed model approach was used to analyze the expenditures.
RESULTS: A total of 9,471 children with ASD were included in the study. Although the pre-mandate total expenditures per child with ASD were similar, the post-mandate expenditures significantly increased for groups subject to the autism mandate (87% increase from $7,754 in 2008 to $14,486 in 2010) compared to the exempt groups (27% increase from $7,238 to $9,171). By insurance type, the change from 2008 to 2010 in ASD-related expenditures per child with ASD was $8,439 for fully insured large employer sponsored plans and $43 for the Children's Health Insurance Program (CHIP), both subject to the PA mandate; and $2,631 for the self-insured, $980 for small-employers, and $-92 for individual plans, all of which are exempt from the mandate. These increases were due to outpatient services but not inpatient or drug costs.
CONCLUSIONS: Healthcare expenditures increased significantly following the PA autism mandate. Nonexempt, large employer groups had the largest increase in spending. Some exempt, self-insured companies may have voluntarily covered ASD services, leading to a moderate increase.",Research reported in this publication was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health of the National Institutes of Health under Award Number R01MH096711.

One of the many advantages to examining mouse models of human autism is that we are able to examine single gene targets, like that of Neuroligin3 R451C knockin (NL3 KI), which has been directly implicated in human autism. The NL3 KI mouse model has marked volume differences in many different structures in the brain: gray matter structures, such as the hippocampus, the striatum, and the thalamus, were all found to be smaller in the NL3 KI. Further, many white matter structures were found to be significantly smaller, such as the cerebral peduncle, corpus callosum, fornix/fimbria, and internal capsule. Fractional anisotropy measurements in these structures were also measured, and no differences were found. The volume changes in the white matter regions, therefore, are not due to a general breakdown in the microstructure of the tissue and seem to be caused by fewer axons or less mature axons. A larger radial diffusivity was also found in localized regions of the corpus callosum and cerebellum. The corpus callosal changes are particularly interesting as the thinning (or reduced volume) of the corpus callosum is a consistent finding in autism. This suggests that the NL3 KI model may be useful for examining white matter changes associated with autism.","This study was supported by the Canadian Institute for Health Research (Operating), and the Ontario Mental Health Foundation (Salary, J.E.).",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806","Animals; Autistic Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cell Adhesion Molecules, Neuronal; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Disease Models, Animal; Imaging, Three-Dimensional; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Membrane Proteins; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Organ Size",31/08/2011,2011,31/08/2011,2011-10,4,5,368-376,Closed,Article,"Ellegood, Jacob; Lerch, Jason P.; Henkelman, R.

The feasibility of adapting low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy for depression to meet the needs of autistic adults via a randomised controlled trial was investigated. The adapted intervention (guided self-help) comprised materials for nine individual sessions with a low-intensity psychological therapist. Autistic adults (n = 70) with depression (Patient Health Questionnaire-9 score ⩾10) recruited from National Health Service adult autism services and research cohorts were randomly allocated to guided self-help or treatment as usual. Outcomes at 10-, 16- and 24-weeks post-randomisation were blind to treatment group. Rates of retention in the study differed by treatment group with more participants attending follow-up in the guided self-help group than treatment as usual. The adapted intervention was well-received, 86% (n = 30/35) of participants attended the pre-defined 'dose' of five sessions of treatment and 71% (25/35) attended all treatment sessions. The findings of this pilot randomised controlled trial indicate that low-intensity cognitive behaviour therapy informed by behavioural activation can be successfully adapted to meet the needs of autistic people. Evaluation of the effectiveness of this intervention in a full scale randomised controlled trial is now warranted.","We would like to acknowledge the support of the West of England and Northeast and North Cumbria Clinical Research Networks.

We assessed the effects of age on cortical thickness in individuals with ASD, between the ages of 7 and 39 years in comparison to typically developing controls. Additionally, we examined differences in cortical thickness in relation to symptomatology in the ASD group, and their association with age. Analyses were conducted using a general linear model, controlling for sex. Social and communication scores from the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) were correlated with the thickness of regions implicated in those functions. Controls showed widespread cortical thinning relative to the ASD group. Within regions-of-interest, increased thickness in the rostral anterior cingulate cortex was associated with poorer social scores. Additionally, a significant interaction between age and social impairment was found in the orbitofrontal cortex, with more impaired younger children having decreased thickness in this region. These results suggest that differential neurodevelopmental trajectories are present in individuals with ASD and some differences are associated with diagnostic behaviours.","The data for this study were collected at Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York, New York.

Whether preschoolers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) respond similarly to bids for joint attention during SBR and how autism characteristics impact upon their responsiveness is currently unclear. This is important given these children are at risk of persistent language and literacy challenges. To address this, we examined the effects of prompts that were solely verbal versus verbal with pointing on visual attention to print and picture targets during SBR with digital storybooks for 34 children with ASD and 27 TD peers. Children with ASD looked as frequently at print targets, but less frequently at picture targets, when prompted compared to TD peers. Both prompt types showed similar effects in shifting children's visual attention to print and picture targets at group level. When groups were combined, autism characteristics influenced children's responsiveness to verbal versus verbal with pointing prompts to print targets, but not to picture targets; children looked more frequently at print targets as autism characteristics increased when verbal prompts were used, with a large effect shown (d = 0.91). Overall, findings suggest that prompting children with ASD to look at print and pictures during SBR with digital storybooks may be helpful in facilitating joint attention to storybook content. Implications for the development of effective early interventions aimed at providing emergent literacy support for children with ASD are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: We looked at how prompting impacted upon where children with autism look during shared book reading with digital storybooks compared to children without autism using eye-tracking. We found the target (pictures or print) was what mattered and number of autism characteristics impacted how responsive children were to different types of prompts. This helps us to understand how prompting may help children with autism to look at print or pictures during shared book reading which could support language or reading interventions.",This research was supported by a Queensland Registration Board Legacy Fund research grant awarded by Speech Pathology Australia.

Despite overall improvement, there were minor differences between the adaptive and mock-training conditions. Moreover, dropout was relatively high (26%). In the current study we explored potential predicting and moderating factors to clarify these findings. The effects of intelligence, autism traits, WM, flexibility, reward sensitivity and Theory of Mind on dropout, improvement during training, and improvement in everyday executive functioning (EF), ASD-like behavior, and Quality of Life (QoL) were studied. None of the predictors influenced dropout or training improvement. However, 1) more pre-training autism traits related to less improvement in EF and QoL, and 2) higher reward sensitivity was related to more improvement in QoL and ASD-like behavior. These findings suggest that these EF-training procedures may be beneficial for children with fewer autism traits and higher reward sensitivity. However, the exploratory nature of the analyses warrant further research before applying the findings clinically.","The authors thank all children and their parents for participating, the students for testing the participants, and the mental health-care institutions for helping with patient recruitment.

Individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been found to have altered ToM skills, which significantly impacts the quality of their social interactions. Neuroimaging studies have reported altered activation of the ToM cortical network, especially in adults with autism, yet little is known about the brain responses underlying ToM in younger individuals with ASD. This functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study investigated the neural mechanisms underlying ToM in high-functioning children and adolescents with ASD and matched typically developing (TD) peers.MethodsfMRI data were acquired from 13 participants with ASD and 13 TD control participants while they watched animations involving two “interacting” geometrical shapes.ResultsParticipants with ASD showed significantly reduced activation, relative to TD controls, in regions considered part of the ToM network, the mirror network, and the cerebellum. Functional connectivity analyses revealed underconnectivity between frontal and posterior regions during task performance in the ASD participants.ConclusionsOverall, the findings of this study reveal disruptions in the brain circuitry underlying ToM in ASD at multiple levels, including decreased activation and decreased functional connectivity.","This study was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health (R01-MH-29617 to M.A.J) and the McNulty-Civitan Scientist Award to RKK.

The review considers two main types of study: those that examined the prevalence of people with ASD in the CJS and those that examined the prevalence of offending in populations with ASD. In addition, types of offences in people with ASD, co-morbid psychiatric diagnoses, and characteristics of people with ASD who commit offences (including predisposing factors) are considered. A combination of search terms was used in a variety of databases in order to find all of the available literature on this topic, and research studies were included based on specified inclusion and exclusion criteria. It was found that whilst there is an emerging literature base on this topic, there are a wide variety of methodologies used, making direct comparison difficult. Nevertheless it can be concluded so far that people with ASD do not seem to be disproportionately over-represented in the CJS, though they commit a range of crimes and seem to have a number of predisposing features. There is poor evidence of the presence of comorbid psychiatric diagnoses (except in mental health settings) amongst offenders with ASD, and little evidence of the oft-asserted over-representation of certain kinds of crimes. It is recommended that further research of good quality is required in this area, rather than studies that examine populations that are not representative of all those with ASD.",,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Comorbidity; Crime; Criminal Law; Criminals; Humans; Mental Disorders; Prevalence; Risk Factors",28/02/2014,2014,28/02/2014,2014-11,44,11,2717-2733,All OA; Green,Article,"King, Claire; Murphy, Glynis H.","King, Claire (Tizard Centre, University of Kent, Giles Lane, CT2 7LR, Canterbury, Kent, UK); Murphy, Glynis H.

This feature was recently added to the diagnostic manual for autism (Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, 5th ed. (DSM-5)). To measure sensory sensitivities, the Sensory Perception Quotient (SPQ) has been developed. In this study, we tested whether a Dutch translation of the abridged SPQ-Short yields similar results as the original English version. We also tested whether this questionnaire can measure modality specific sensitivities. To this end, 657 adults with autism spectrum disorder and 585 adults without an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis filled out the Dutch SPQ-Short. The Dutch questionnaire data were very similar to the original English version: adults with autism spectrum disorder were more sensitive compared with adults without autism spectrum disorder. Women with autism spectrum disorder are more sensitive compared with men with autism spectrum disorder. Gender did not have an effect in the group without autism spectrum disorder. Individuals reporting higher sensory sensitivities also reported more autistic traits (such as lower social interests, or increased fascination for patterns). Finally, we found that the Dutch SPQ-Short is suited to measure modality-specific sensitivities. We conclude that the Dutch translation is a viable tool to measure sensory sensitivities in adults with and without autism spectrum disorder and can be used to further our understanding of differences in perception in people with or without autism spectrum disorder.",The authors thank all the participants for their time and energy investment in this study.,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Male; Perception; Surveys and Questionnaires,28/07/2020,2020,28/07/2020,2020-11,24,8,2071-2080,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Weiland, Ricarda F; Polderman, Tinca JC; Hoekstra, Rosa A; Smit, Dirk JA; Begeer, Sander","Weiland, Ricarda F (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Polderman, Tinca JC (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Hoekstra, Rosa A (King’s College London, UK); Smit, Dirk JA (Academic Medical Center, Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Begeer, Sander (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, The Netherlands)","Weiland, Ricarda F (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)","Weiland, Ricarda F (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Polderman, Tinca JC (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Hoekstra, Rosa A (King's College London); Smit, Dirk JA (Academic Medical Center); Begeer, Sander (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)",King's College London; Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam; Academic Medical Center,grid.13097.3c; grid.12380.38; grid.5650.6,United Kingdom; Netherlands; Netherlands,Netherlands Organisation for Health Research and Development,12,12,2.19,5.27,7,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320942085,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1129695970,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,,No,,,

Twenty-five participants completed treatment. A modified dose finding method was used to determine safety and dose response among three dose levels: 0.25 mg/kg, 0.5 mg/kg, and 0.75 mg/kg once daily.ResultsMaximum tolerated dose: there were no serious adverse events (SAEs) and as such the maximum tolerated dose within the range tested was 0.75 mg/Kg once daily.Safety: overall, pioglitazone was well tolerated. Two participants discontinued intervention due to perceived non-efficacy and one due to the inability to tolerate interim blood work. Three participants experienced mild neutropenia.Early evidence of efficacy: statistically significant improvement was observed in social withdrawal, repetitive behaviors, and externalizing behaviors as measured by the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC), Child Yale-Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale (CY-BOCS), and Repetitive Behavior Scale–Revised (RBS-R). Forty-six percent of those enrolled were deemed to be global responders.Conclusions and relevancePioglitazone is well-tolerated and shows a potential signal in measures of social withdrawal, repetitive, and externalizing behaviors.

Using data from 60 age- and IQ-matched men and women with autism (without intellectual disability), we operationalized camouflaging in adults with autism for the first time as the quantitative discrepancy between the person's 'external' behavioural presentation in social-interpersonal contexts (measured by the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule) and the person's 'internal' status (dispositional traits measured by the Autism Spectrum Quotient and social cognitive capability measured by the 'Reading the Mind in the Eyes' Test). We found that the operationalized camouflaging measure was not significantly correlated with age or IQ. On average, women with autism had higher camouflaging scores than men with autism (Cohen's d = 0.98), with substantial variability in both groups. Greater camouflaging was associated with more depressive symptoms in men and better signal-detection sensitivity in women with autism. The neuroanatomical association with camouflaging score was largely sex/gender-dependent and significant only in women: from reverse inference, the most correlated cognitive terms were about emotion and memory. The underlying constructs, measurement, mechanisms, consequences and heterogeneity of camouflaging in autism warrant further investigation.","The Medical Research Council Autism Imaging Multicentre Study Consortium (MRC AIMS Consortium) is a UK collaboration between the Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology &amp; Neuroscience (IoPPN) at King’s College, London, the Autism Research Centre, University of Cambridge, and the Autism Research Group, University of Oxford.

The aim of this systematic review was to provide an overview and critically evaluate the current evidence on the efficacy and safety of probiotic, prebiotic, synbiotic, and fecal microbiota transplantation therapies for core and co-occurring behavioral symptoms in individuals with ASD. Comprehensive searches of MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, Web of Science Core Collection, Cochrane Library, and Google Scholar were performed from inception to March 5, 2020, and two update searches were completed on October 25, 2020, and April 22, 2021, respectively. A total of 4306 publications were identified, of which 14 articles met the inclusion criteria. Data were extracted independently by two reviewers using a preconstructed form. Results of probiotic studies do not confirm the supposed beneficial effect of probiotics on ASD, whereas prebiotics and synbiotic combinations appear to be efficacious in selective behavioral symptoms. Evidence of the efficacy of fecal microbiota transplantation in ASD is still scarce but supports further research. Overall, the current evidence base to suggest beneficial effects of these modalities in ASD is limited and inconclusive. More clinical trials are currently looking at the use of microbial-based therapies in ASD. With a robust double-blind randomized controlled protocol to investigate the efficacy, these trials should provide significant and definitive results. LAY SUMMARY: There is a link between altered gut bacteria and autism spectrum disorder. Some people believe that modulating bacterial composition in the gut may help reduce autism symptoms, but evidence from human studies suggesting beneficial effects of probiotic, prebiotic, and combination thereof as well as fecal transplants in autism spectrum disorder is limited and inconclusive. Current data should not encourage use of these modalities.

Thirty-seven children (7–13 years old) were randomly assigned to a 9-week functional behavior-based cognitive behavior therapy (Fb-CBT) or Treatment As Usual. Independent assessors administered measures pre- and post-treatment and at 6-months. Two primary outcome measures indicated statistically significant differences between groups, with large corrected effect sizes (Hedge’s g = 1.00 and 1.15, respectively). This is the first known RCT to exclusively treat obsessive compulsive behaviors (OCBs) in children and youth with high functioning (IQ ≥ 70) ASD, and suggests that Fb-CBT treatment shows promise in decreasing these behaviors and improving quality of life.

This study examines the implementation of Reciprocal Imitation Training (RIT)-an NDBI-by community Early Intervention (EI; IDEA Part C) providers serving toddlers from birth to 3 years. Of the 87 EI providers enrolled from 9 agencies in 4 counties across Washington State, 66 were included in the current sample. A stepped-wedge design was used to randomly assign counties to the timing of RIT training workshops. Self-report measures of practice and self-efficacy regarding ASD care were collected at baseline (T1, T2) and 6-months and 12-months post-training (T3, T4). At T3 and T4, providers reported on RIT adoption and rated items about RIT feasibility and perceived RIT effectiveness; at T4, they also reported on child characteristics that led to RIT use and modifications. From pre-training to post-training, there were significant increases in providers' self-efficacy in providing services to children with ASD or suspected ASD. At T3 and T4, provider ratings indicated high levels of RIT adoption, feasibility, and perceived RIT effectiveness. At T4, providers indicated that they most commonly: (a) initiated RIT when there were social-communication or motor imitation delays, or an ASD diagnosis; and (b) made modifications to RIT by repeating elements, blending it with other therapies, and loosening its structure. While additional research is needed, RIT may help families get an early start on accessing specialized treatment within an established infrastructure available across the United States. LAY SUMMARY: Reciprocal imitation training (RIT) is an evidence-based treatment for ASD that might be a good fit for use by intervention providers in widely accessible community-based settings. After attending an educational workshop on RIT, providers reported feeling more comfortable providing services to families with ASD concerns, used RIT with over 400 families, and believed that RIT improved important social communication behaviors.","The authors acknowledge the contributions of our exceptional investigative team: Shannon Dorsey, PhD, Kathleen Myers, PhD, Kyle Steinman, MD, Ann Vander Stoep, PhD, and Chuan Zhou, PhD.

A composite measure of the ""pace of aging"" was derived by tracking the decline in 19 biomarkers across ages 26, 32, 38, and 45 years. Facial age was also assessed. Reports of perceived health were collected from participants themselves, informants, and interviewers. Higher self-reported autistic traits significantly correlated with a faster pace of aging, older facial age, and poorer self-, informant-, and interviewer-rated health. After control for sex, SES and IQ, autistic traits were significantly associated with each variable: pace of aging (β = 0.09), facial age (β = 0.08), self- (β = -0.15), informant (β = -0.12), and interviewer-rated (β = -0.17) health. Autistic traits measured at age 45 are associated with faster aging. Participants with high autistic traits appear to be more vulnerable to poor health outcomes, as previously reported for those clinically diagnosed with ASD. Therefore, autistic traits may have important health implications. Replicating these findings in samples of autistic people is needed to identify the mechanism of their effect on aging and physical health to improve outcomes for those with ASD diagnoses or high autistic traits. LAY SUMMARY: The role that autistic traits have in relation to health outcomes has not been investigated. We looked at how physical health and aging (measured with self-reported questions and decline in multiple biological measures) were related to autistic traits (measured with a questionnaire, at age 45). We found that higher autistic traits were associated with poorer reports of physical health, and a faster pace of aging. This suggests that both those with autism and those with higher autistic traits may be more likely to experience poorer health outcomes.","We thank the members of the Advisory Board for the Dunedin Study, Dunedin Study members including their families and friends, Unit research staff, and Study founder Phil Silva, PhD, University of Otago.

However, the neurobiological basis of this hypothesis is underspecified because it is unknown whether ASD relates to abnormalities of the amygdaloid input or output nuclei. Here, we investigated the functional connectivity of the amygdaloid social-perceptual input nuclei and emotion-regulation output nuclei in ASD versus controls.MethodsWe collected resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data, tailored to provide optimal sensitivity in the amygdala as well as the neocortex, in 20 adolescents and young adults with ASD and 25 matched controls. We performed a regular correlation analysis between the entire amygdala (EA) and the whole brain and used a partial correlation analysis to investigate whole-brain functional connectivity uniquely related to each of the amygdaloid subregions.ResultsBetween-group comparison of regular EA correlations showed significantly reduced connectivity in visuospatial and superior parietal areas in ASD compared to controls. Partial correlation analysis revealed that this effect was driven by the left superficial and right laterobasal input subregions, but not the centromedial output nuclei.ConclusionsThese results indicate reduced connectivity of specifically the amygdaloid sensory input channels in ASD, suggesting that abnormal amygdalo-cortical connectivity can be traced down to the socio-perceptual pathways.",This work was supported by the Hersenstichting Fellowship (F2010(1)-13).

A diagnosis of autism can help self-awareness and self-understanding. However, it can be difficult for adults to access an autism assessment. Clinicians also sometimes find it hard to identify autism in adults. This may mean an autism diagnosis is delayed or missed. In this study, we asked autistic adults, relatives and clinicians how to improve this. The study was in two stages. In the first stage (stage 1), 343 autistic adults and 45 relatives completed a survey. In the survey, we asked questions about people's experiences of UK autism assessment services for adults. Thirty-five clinicians completed a similar survey. Clinicians reported that some autism assessment teams lacked key professionals, for example, psychologists and occupational therapists. We used the information from the three separate surveys to create 13 statements describing best autism assessment services for adults. In stage 2, we asked clinicians for their views on the 13 statements. Clinicians agreed with 11 of the statements. Some autistic adults, relatives and clinicians were positive about autism assessment services, and many also described areas that could be improved.

Despite the importance of the parent-professional partnership, there is a dearth of cultural-specific data on parent-professional partnership in the Chinese context. We conducted 10 in-depth life-history interviews with parents of children with autism spectrum conditions in Hong Kong who were diagnosed during preschool years. Using an interpretative phenomenological analytic method, five themes were constructed to represent the context of parent-professional partnership in Hong Kong along the pathway of seeking a diagnosis: (a) access to the assessment and diagnosis of autism spectrum conditions, (b) multiple procedures of assessment, (c) consultation prior to diagnosis and assessment, (d) communication of diagnosis and assessment result and (e) post-assessment isolation. Parental narratives highlight the important domains of parent-professional partnership and reflect the complexity of diagnosis and the lack of a cohesive system. For many parents, the assessment procedure was marred by a series of obstacles, which were further exacerbated by a poorly developed parent-professional partnership. Suggestions for parent-professional partnership development include establishing an evidence-based best practice guideline for Hong Kong, creating pre-assessment information workshops for parents to attend and equipping professionals with knowledge about autism spectrum conditions and enhanced communication skills.",The authors thank the participants in this research for their time and the community organisations staff members who helped us to conduct the interviews and who work to enhance the well-being of families of children with ASC.

One of these approaches is modulation of activity of the brain regions involved in ASD symptoms. This study examined the effects of transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC) on autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functions in children with ASD. Thirty-two children (Mage  = 10.16, SD = 1.93, range 7-12 years) diagnosed with ASD were randomly assigned to active (N = 17) or sham stimulation (N = 15) groups in a randomized, sham-controlled, parallel-group design. Participants underwent 10 sessions of active (1.5 mA, 15 min, bilateral left anodal/right cathodal DLPFC, 2 sessions per week) or sham tDCS. Autism symptom severity, theory of mind, emotion regulation strategies, and emotional-behavioral functioning of the patients were assessed at baseline, immediately after the intervention, and 1 month after the intervention. A significant improvement of autism symptom severity (i.e., communication), theory of mind (i.e., ToM 3), and emotion regulation strategies was observed for the active as compared to the sham stimulation group at the end of the intervention, and these effects were maintained at the one-month follow-up. The results suggest that repeated tDCS with anodal stimulation of left and cathodal stimulation of right DLPFC improves autism symptom severity as well as social cognition and emotion regulation in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: Previous research has suggested that targeting core mechanisms underlying cognitive-emotional and behavioral deficits of autistic children might improve symptoms of ASD. Deficient social and behavioral functioning, impaired theory of mind, and emotional regulation deficits have been identified as core treatment targets for this group. Specific subregions of the prefrontal cortex are involved in these deficits, including hypoactivity of the dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (DLPFC). Upregulation of this area with non-invasive brain stimulation, namely anodal transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS), results in improved social and behavioral functioning in children with ASD. Very few studies have however examined the effects of this intervention on theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems. We examined the effects of anodal tDCS over the left DLPFC (F3), combined with cathodal tDCS over the right DLPFC (F4) on autism symptom severity as well as theory of mind, emotional regulation, and emotional-behavioral problems of children with ASD. This intervention improved autism symptom severity, specific domains of theory of mind, and emotion regulation. These findings have clinical implications for the treatment of ASD and suggest that targeting core mechanisms underlying socio-cognitive-emotional deficits of autistic children using tDCS might improve symptoms of ASD.","We gratefully acknowledge the staff of Kanian Rehabilitation Clinic for Autism Spectrum Disorder (Sanandaj, Kurdistan, Iran) who enabled the administration and continuation of this study.

However, no studies have explored the prevalence of dyspraxia in a large sample of individuals with and without ASC or associations between dyspraxia and autistic traits in these individuals.MethodsTwo thousand eight hundred seventy-one adults (with ASC) and 10,706 controls (without ASC) self-reported whether they have been diagnosed with dyspraxia. A subsample of participants then completed the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ; 1237 ASC and 6765 controls) and the Empathy Quotient (EQ; 1147 ASC and 6129 controls) online through the Autism Research Centre website. The prevalence of dyspraxia was compared between those with and without ASC. AQ and EQ scores were compared across the four groups: (1) adults with ASC with dyspraxia, (2) adults with ASC without dyspraxia, (3) controls with dyspraxia, and (4) controls without dyspraxia.ResultsAdults with ASC were significantly more likely to report a diagnosis of dyspraxia (6.9%) than those without ASC (0.8%). In the ASC group, those with co-morbid diagnosis of dyspraxia did not have significantly different AQ or EQ scores than those without co-morbid dyspraxia. However, in the control group (without ASC), those with dyspraxia had significantly higher AQ and lower EQ scores than those without dyspraxia.ConclusionsDyspraxia is significantly more prevalent in adults with ASC compared to controls, confirming reports that motor coordination difficulties are significantly more common in this group. Interestingly, in the general population, dyspraxia was associated with significantly higher autistic traits and lower empathy. These results suggest that motor coordination skills are important for effective social skills and empathy.",Not applicable.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Adolescent; Adult; Aged; Apraxias; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Empathy; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Phenotype; Psychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Social Skills; Surveys and Questionnaires,25/11/2016,2016,25/11/2016,2016-12,7,1,48,All OA; Gold,Article,"Cassidy, Sarah; Hannant, Penelope; Tavassoli, Teresa; Allison, Carrie; Smith, Paula; Baron-Cohen, Simon","Cassidy, Sarah (Centre for Psychology, Behaviour and Achievement, Coventry University, Priory Street, CV1 5FB, Coventry, UK; Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Douglas House, 18B Trumpington Road, CB2 8AH, Cambridge, UK); Hannant, Penelope (Centre for Psychology, Behaviour and Achievement, Coventry University, Priory Street, CV1 5FB, Coventry, UK); Tavassoli, Teresa (Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Douglas House, 18B Trumpington Road, CB2 8AH, Cambridge, UK; The Centre for Research in Autism and Education, UCL Institute of Education, University College London, 55-59 Gordon Square, WC1H 0NU, London, UK); Allison, Carrie (Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Douglas House, 18B Trumpington Road, CB2 8AH, Cambridge, UK); Smith, Paula (Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Douglas House, 18B Trumpington Road, CB2 8AH, Cambridge, UK); Baron-Cohen, Simon (Autism Research Centre, Department of Psychiatry, University of Cambridge, Douglas House, 18B Trumpington Road, CB2 8AH, Cambridge, UK; CLASS Clinic, Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, Cambridge, UK)","Cassidy, Sarah (Coventry University; University of Cambridge)","Cassidy, Sarah (Coventry University; University of Cambridge); Hannant, Penelope (Coventry University); Tavassoli, Teresa (University of Cambridge; University College London); Allison, Carrie (University of Cambridge); Smith, Paula (University of Cambridge); Baron-Cohen, Simon (University of Cambridge; Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust)",University of Cambridge; University College London; Coventry University; Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust,grid.5335.0; grid.83440.3b; grid.8096.7; grid.450563.1,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Economic and Social Research Council; National Institute for Health Research; Department of Health and Social Care; Medical Research Council; Wellcome Trust,22,10,1.13,4.52,32,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-016-0112-x,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1013791692,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences; 3209 Neurosciences; 52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,

About 50% of children with autism are not talking by age 3 and up to 30% of children with autism will remain minimally verbal past age 5. Interventions delivered by clinicians and caregivers have the greatest effects on spoken language and may reduce the rate of those who remain minimally verbal. Sixty-eight children ages 3-5 with autism and their caregivers participated in this randomized trial comparing the communication intervention to a comparison group. A brief, multi-component, communication intervention (including a speech-generating device) for children with autism that addresses core deficits may be effective in improving joint attention skills immediately following intervention and social communication skills 4 months following intervention.

However, long-term follow-up studies, evaluating the possibility of long-lasting retention effects, are currently lacking.MethodsUsing a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled, parallel design, this pilot clinical trial explored the possibility of long-lasting behavioral effects of 4 weeks of intranasal oxytocin treatment (24 International Units once daily in the morning) in 40 adult men with ASD. To do so, self-report and informant-based questionnaires assessing core autism symptoms and characterizations of attachment were administered at baseline, immediately after 4 weeks of treatment (approximately 24 h after the last nasal spray administration), and at two follow-up sessions, 4 weeks and 1 year post-treatment.ResultsNo treatment-specific effects were identified in the primary outcome assessing social symptoms (Social Responsiveness Scale, self- and informant-rated). In particular, with respect to self-reported social responsiveness, improvements were evident both in the oxytocin and in the placebo group, yielding no significant between-group difference (p = .37). Also informant-rated improvements in social responsiveness were not significantly larger in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (between-group difference: p = .19). Among the secondary outcome measures, treatment-specific improvements were identified in the Repetitive Behavior Scale and State Adult Attachment Measure, indicating reductions in self-reported repetitive behaviors (p = .04) and reduced feelings of avoidance toward others (p = .03) in the oxytocin group compared to the placebo group, up to 1 month and even 1 year post-treatment. Treatment-specific effects were also revealed in screenings of mood states (Profile of Mood States), indicating higher reports of “vigor” (feeling energetic, active, lively) in the oxytocin, compared to the placebo group (p = .03).ConclusionsWhile no treatment-specific improvements were evident in terms of core social symptoms, the current observations of long-term beneficial effects on repetitive behaviors and feelings of avoidance are promising and suggestive of a therapeutic potential of oxytocin treatment for ASD. However, given the exploratory nature of this pilot study, future studies are warranted to evaluate the long-term effects of OT administration further.Trial registrationThe trial was registered with the European Clinical Trial Registry (Eudract 2014-000586-45) on January 22, 2014 (https://www.clinicaltrialsregister.eu/ctr-search/trial/2014-000586-45/BE).",We are thankful to all the participating subjects and all the master students who helped with the data collection.

Yet, most of this research has focused on loneliness in autistic children and young people. We present the results of a systematic review on loneliness in autistic adults. A systematic review is a rigorous way of searching for all existing research on a topic and summarizing the findings about specific questions. We searched for all research published on this topic until 9 April 2021. We found 34 articles that investigated loneliness in autistic adults. This research showed that (1) there is fairly little research that has involved directly asking autistic adults about their first-hand experiences of loneliness (e.g. what loneliness feels like for them); (2) few research studies have used loneliness questionnaires specifically developed for autistic adults (this was attempted in just one research study); (3) collective loneliness (i.e. loneliness associated with how much an autistic person feels they 'fit in' to society) seems important to autistic adults but has not been investigated as commonly as other aspects of loneliness (e.g. loneliness associated with romantic relationships or friendships); (4) things that might increase loneliness in autistic adults include anxiety and depression, and a lack of autism understanding and acceptance, for example; and (5) things that might reduce loneliness in autistic adults include having relationships and self-acceptance, for example.

Such inconsistent findings may be driven by atypical neurodevelopmental trajectories in ASD during adolescence, but no longitudinal studies to date have investigated this hypothesis. We thus examined the functional connectivity of three neurocognitive resting-state networks-the default mode network (DMN), salience network, and central executive network (CEN)-in a longitudinal sample of youth with ASD (n = 16) and without ASD (n = 22) studied during early/mid- and late adolescence. Functional connectivity between the CEN and the DMN displayed significantly altered developmental trajectories in ASD: typically developing (TD) controls-but not youth with ASD-exhibited an increase in negative functional connectivity between these two networks with age. This significant interaction was due to the ASD group displaying less negative functional connectivity than the TD group during late adolescence only, with no significant group differences in early/mid-adolescence. These preliminary findings suggest a localized age-dependency of functional connectivity alterations in ASD and underscore the importance of considering age when examining brain connectivity. Autism Research 2019, 12: 53-65. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Brain connectivity may develop differently during adolescence in youth with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We looked at changes in brain connectivity over time within individuals and found that, for some brain regions, adolescents with ASD did not show the same changes in brain connectivity that typically developing adolescents did. This suggests it is important to consider age when studying brain connectivity in ASD.","This work was supported by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (award number P50HD055784 to S.Y.B.), the National Institute of Mental Health (award number F31MH110140 to K.E.L. and T32MH073526 to L.M.H.), the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (award number T32NS048004 to K.E.L. and F99NS105206 to L.M.H.), and the ARCS Foundation.

However, several recent meta-analyses indicate that SST curricula may fall short of these goals. We offer an explanation for these potentially null effects by illustrating how the content of these curricula diverge from empirical evidence derived from disciplines that take social interaction as their object of study. Next, we argue that employing the social rules advocated for by SST curricula may work counterproductively by inhibiting authenticity, while at the same time increasing stigma associated with ASD.

Social skills interventions have been found to ameliorate socio-communication deficits in children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorders. Little is known about the effectiveness of social skills interventions for adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders (hf-ASD) - a clinical population who can present with more subtle core deficits, but comparable levels of impairment and secondary difficulties. A systematic review was undertaken to investigate the effectiveness of social skills interventions for adults with high-functioning autism spectrum disorders. Five studies met the pre-specified review inclusion criteria: two quasi-experimental comparative trials and three single-arm interventions. There was a degree of variation in the structure, duration and content of the social skills interventions delivered, as well as several methodological limitations associated with included studies. Nevertheless, narrative analysis tentatively indicates that group social skills interventions may be effective for enhancing social knowledge and understanding, improving social functioning, reducing loneliness and potentially alleviating co-morbid psychiatric symptoms.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Humans; Psychotherapy, Group; Social Skills",04/06/2015,2015,04/06/2015,2015-10,19,7,874-886,Closed,Article,"Spain, Debbie; Blainey, Sarah H","Spain, Debbie (King’s College London, UK; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK); Blainey, Sarah H (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust, UK)","Spain, Debbie (King's College London; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust)","Spain, Debbie (King's College London; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust); Blainey, Sarah H (South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust)",King's College London; South London and Maudsley NHS Foundation Trust,grid.13097.3c; grid.37640.36,United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Department of Health and Social Care,71,22,2.96,9.91,18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1043701129,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,

We tested and compared the overall and item-level intervention effects of the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change (BOSCC), Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) algorithm, and ADOS-2 Calibrated Severity Scores (CSS) with autistic children aged 2-5 years from the Preschool Autism Communication Trial (PACT). The BOSCC was applied to Module 1 ADOS assessments (ADOS-BOSCC). Among the 117 children using single or no words (Module 1), the ADOS-BOSCC, ADOS algorithm, and ADOS CSS each detected small non-significant intervention effects. However, on the ADOS algorithm, there was a medium significant intervention effect for children with ""few to no words"" at baseline, while children with ""some words"" showed little intervention effect. For the full PACT sample (including ADOS Module 2, total n=152), ADOS metrics evidenced significant small (CSS) and medium (algorithm) overall intervention effects. None of the Module 1 item-level intervention effects reached significance, with largest changes observed for Gesture (ADOS-BOSCC and ADOS), Facial Expressions (ADOS), and Intonation (ADOS). Significant ADOS Module 2 item-level effects were observed for Mannerisms and Repetitive Interests and Stereotyped Behaviors. Despite strong psychometric properties, the ADOS-BOSCC was not more sensitive to behavioral changes than the ADOS among Module 1 children. Our results suggest the ADOS can be a sensitive outcome measure. Item-level intervention effect plots have the potential to indicate intervention ""signatures of change,"" a concept that may be useful in future trials and systematic reviews. LAY SUMMARY: This study compares two outcome measures in a parent-mediated therapy. Neither was clearly better or worse than the other; however, the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule produced somewhat clearer evidence than the Brief Observation of Social Communication Change of improvement among children who had use of ""few to no"" words at the start. We explore which particular behaviors are associated with greater improvement. These findings can inform researchers when they consider how best to explore the impact of their intervention.","The authors gratefully thank all families who participated in the study.

However, few functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) studies of ASDs have focused on anxiety (and fewer still on anxiety in middle-aged adults). Thus, relationships between atypical connectivity and anxiety in this population are poorly understood. The current study contrasted functional connectivity within anxiety network regions across adults (40-64 years) with and without autism, and tested for group by functional connectivity interactions on anxiety. Twenty-two adults with ASDs (16 males) and 26 typical control (TC) adults (22 males) completed the Beck Anxiety Inventory and a resting-state fMRI scan. An anxiety network consisting of 12 regions of interest was defined, based on a meta-analysis in TC individuals and two studies on anxiety in ASDs. We tested for main effects of group and group by anxiety interactions on connectivity within this anxiety network, controlling for head motion using ANCOVA. Results are reported at an FDR adjusted threshold of q < 0.1 (corrected) and p < 0.05 (uncorrected). Adults with ASDs showed higher anxiety and underconnectivity within the anxiety network, mostly involving bilateral insula. Connectivity within the anxiety network in the ASD group showed distinct relationships with anxiety symptoms that did not relate to ASD symptom severity. Functional connectivity involving the bilateral posterior insula was positively correlated with anxiety in the ASD (but not the TC) group. Increased anxiety in middle-aged adults with ASD is associated with atypical functional connectivity, predominantly involving bilateral insula. Results were not related to ASD symptom severity suggesting independence of anxiety-related effects. LAY SUMMARY: Anxiety is very common in adults with autism but the brain basis of this difference is not well understood. We compared functional connectivity between anxiety-related brain regions in middle-aged adults with and without autism. Adults with autism were more anxious and showed weaker functional connections between these regions. Some relationships between functional connectivity and higher anxiety were specific to the autism group. Results suggest that anxiety functions differently in autism.","Our sincere thanks to our participants and their families for sharing their time with us.

Previous research has reported reductions in ASSRs at 40 Hz for autism spectrum disorder (ASD) participants and first-degree relatives of people diagnosed with ASD (Mol Autism. 2011;2:11, Biol Psychiatry. 2007;62:192–197).MethodsUsing a 1.5 s-long auditory clicktrain stimulus, designed to elicit an ASSR at 40 Hz, this study attempted to replicate and extend these findings. Magnetencephalography (MEG) data were collected from 18 adolescent ASD participants and 18 typically developing controls.ResultsThe ASSR localised to bilateral primary auditory regions. Regions of interest were thus defined in left and right primary auditory cortex (A1). While the transient gamma-band response (tGBR) from 0-0.1 s following presentation of the clicktrain stimulus was not different between groups, for either left or right A1, the ASD group had reduced oscillatory power at 40 Hz from 0.5 to 1.5 s post-stimulus onset, for both left and right A1. Additionally, the ASD group had reduced inter-trial coherence (phase consistency over trials) at 40 Hz from 0.64-0.82 s for right A1 and 1.04-1.22 s for left A1.LimitationsIn this study, we did not conduct a clinical autism assessment (e.g. the ADOS), and therefore, it remains unclear whether ASSR power and/or ITC are associated with the clinical symptoms of ASD.ConclusionOverall, our results support a specific reduction in ASSR oscillatory power and inter-trial coherence in ASD, rather than a generalised deficit in gamma-band responses. We argue that this could reflect a developmentally relevant reduction in non-linear neural processing.",We wish to thank the volunteers who gave their time to participate in this study; Dr. Shu Yau and Dr. Michael Hall for helping with MRI data acquisition and Dr. Jon Brock for intellectual contributions to experimental design.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Acoustic Stimulation; Adolescent; Auditory Cortex; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Behavior; Female; Gamma Rhythm; Humans; Male,01/07/2020,2020,01/07/2020,2020-12,11,1,56,All OA; Gold,Article,"Seymour, R.

Twenty-five unrelated parents participated in a no-treatment control group. The participants completed online questionnaires prior to and following the 4-month support group, to evaluate changes in mood, anxiety, parenting stress, and positive perceptions. No significant differences between the groups or across time were found. However, parents who participated in the group reported being satisfied with the support they received and finding the group helpful. Issues related to participant recruitment and retention are discussed.

This study explored relations between measures of sensory responsiveness and multisensory speech perception and integration in children with and without ASD. Participants were 8–17 year old children, 18 with ASD and 18 matched typically developing controls. Participants completed a psychophysical speech perception task, and parents reported on children’s sensory responsiveness. Psychophysical measures (e.g., audiovisual accuracy, temporal binding window) were associated with patterns of sensory responsiveness (e.g., hyporesponsiveness, sensory seeking). Results indicate that differences in multisensory speech perception and integration covary with atypical patterns of sensory responsiveness.","This work was supported by NIH U54 HD083211 (PI: Dykens), the Wallace Foundation, the Simons Foundation Autism Research Initiative, a Marino Autism Research Institute Discovery Grant (PI: Mark T.

Children with autism aged 8–13 years (n = 136) were randomized over a waitlist control or treatment condition. At posttest, children in the treatment condition had more ToM knowledge, showed fewer autistic features, and more ToM-related behavior than children in the control condition. Children who had one or two parents with at least a college degree, and children with parents not diagnosed with/suspected of having ASD themselves benefitted from the training.

This study was carried out to estimate the prevalence of autism in a selected population of school-children in India. N = 11,849 children (mean age = 5.9 [SD = 1.3], 39.5% females) were selected from various school types from three boroughs in Kolkata, India. Parents/caregivers and teachers filled in the social and communication disorders checklist (SCDC). Children meeting cutoff on parent-reported SCDC were followed up with the social communication questionnaire (SCQ). SCQ-positive children were administered the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS). Teacher report on SCDC was available on all 11,849 children. Parent-report SCDC scores were obtained for 5,947 children. Mean scores on teacher SCDC were significantly lower than parent SCDC. Out of 1,247 SCDC-positive children, 882 answered the SCQ, of whom 124 met the cutoff score of 15. Six of these children met criteria for autism, autism spectrum disorder (ASD), or broader autism spectrum on the ADOS. The weighted estimate of supra-threshold SCQ scores was 3.54% (CI: 2.88-4.3%). The weighted prevalence estimate of positive scores (for broader autism spectrum + ASD + autism) was 0.23% (0.07-0.46%). As ∼20% children in this state are known to be out of the school system, and ASD prevalence is likely to be higher in this group, this estimate is likely to represent the lower-bound of the true prevalence. This study provides preliminary data on the prevalence of broader-spectrum autism and supra-threshold autistic traits in a population sample of school children in Eastern India.

Children were assigned to either receive comprehensive ESDM intervention for two years, or were encouraged to pursue resources in the community. Two years after intervention, EEG was collected during the execution and observation of grasping actions performed by familiar and unfamiliar agents. The ESDM group showed significantly greater attenuation when viewing a parent or caregiver executing a grasping action, compared with an unfamiliar individual executing the same action. Our findings suggest that the ESDM may have a unique impact on neural circuitry underlying social cognition and familiarity.","We are grateful for the many families that that gave of their time to participate in this study and the many faculty, staff, and students that supported this research at the University of Washington Autism Center.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Cognition; Early Intervention, Educational; Humans; Parents",26/07/2021,2021,26/07/2021,2022-07,52,7,3304-3313,Closed,Article,"Aaronson, Benjamin; Estes, Annette; Rogers, Sally J.; Dawson, Geraldine; Bernier, Raphael","Aaronson, Benjamin (Department of Pediatrics, University of Washington, Box 357920, 98195, Seattle, WA, USA); Estes, Annette (Department of Speech and Hearing Sciences, University of Washington, Seattle, WA, USA); Rogers, Sally J.

Monogenic causes of ASD such as PMS are well suited to investigations with novel therapeutics, as interventions can be targeted based on established genetic etiology. While preclinical studies have demonstrated that the neuropeptide oxytocin can reverse electrophysiological, attentional, and social recognition memory deficits in Shank3-deficient rats, there have been no trials in individuals with PMS. The purpose of this study is to assess the efficacy and safety of intranasal oxytocin as a treatment for the core symptoms of ASD in a cohort of children with PMS.MethodsEighteen children aged 5–17 with PMS were enrolled. Participants were randomized to receive intranasal oxytocin or placebo (intranasal saline) and underwent treatment during a 12-week double-blind, parallel group phase, followed by a 12-week open-label extension phase during which all participants received oxytocin. Efficacy was assessed using the primary outcome of the Aberrant Behavior Checklist-Social Withdrawal (ABC-SW) subscale as well as a number of secondary outcome measures related to the core symptoms of ASD. Safety was monitored throughout the study period.ResultsThere was no statistically significant improvement with oxytocin as compared to placebo on the ABC-SW (Mann–Whitney U = 50, p = 0.055), or on any secondary outcome measures, during either the double-blind or open-label phases. Oxytocin was generally well tolerated, and there were no serious adverse events.
LimitationsThe small sample size, potential challenges with drug administration, and expectancy bias due to relying on parent reported outcome measures may all contribute to limitations in interpreting results.ConclusionOur results suggest that intranasal oxytocin is not efficacious in improving the core symptoms of ASD in children with PMS.Trial registration NCT02710084.",The authors would like to thank the families who participated and the Phelan-McDermid Syndrome Foundation for their support in recruitment.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Chromosome Deletion; Chromosome Disorders; Chromosomes, Human, Pair 22; Humans; Oxytocin",30/09/2021,2021,30/09/2021,2021-12,12,1,62,All OA; Gold,Article,"Fastman, J.; Foss-Feig, J.; Frank, Y.; Halpern, D.; Harony-Nicolas, H.; Layton, C.; Sandin, S.; Siper, P.; Tang, L.; Trelles, P.; Zweifach, J.; Buxbaum, J.

For scientific research and the clinical practice, one needs reliable and valid questionnaires that measure sensory sensitivity and can distinguish between hypo- and hyper-responsiveness. We translated the Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire into Dutch. The aim was to examine the psychometric properties and the clinical use of the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire in 78 autistic and 68 typically developing adults (18-45 years; IQ > 70). Just like the original Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire, the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is a reliable and valid questionnaire. The Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire had reliable hypo- and hyper-responsiveness subscales, reasonable to good modality subscales and was stable over time. Moreover, using the 95th percentile of the typically developing group as cut-off, we showed that two thirds of the autistic adults had heightened sensory sensitivity. We also showed that hypo- and hyper-responsiveness do co-exist in both autistic and typically developing adults. In sum, we conclude that the Dutch Glasgow Sensory Questionnaire is suitable to be used in scientific research as well as in the clinical practice.","We would like to thank the original authors of the GSQ, Dr Ashley Robertson and Dr David Simmons, for their permission to translate the GSQ into Dutch, as well as for their help in the translation process.

However, individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) have been found to have difficulty in attributing intentions to others. The present study investigated the neural mechanisms of inferring intentions from actions in individuals with ASD.MethodsFunctional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) data were acquired from 21 high-functioning young adults with ASD and 22 typically developing (TD) control participants, while making judgments about the means (how an action is performed) and intention (why an action is performed) of a model’s actions.ResultsAcross both groups of participants, the middle and superior temporal cortex, extending to temporoparietal junction, and posterior cingulate cortex, responded significantly to inferring the intent of an action, while inferior parietal lobule and occipital cortices were active for judgments about the means of an action. Participants with ASD had significantly reduced activation in calcarine sulcus and significantly increased activation in left inferior frontal gyrus, compared to TD peers, while attending to the intentions of actions. Also, ASD participants had weaker functional connectivity between frontal and posterior temporal regions while processing intentions.ConclusionsThese results suggest that processing actions and intentions may not be mutually exclusive, with reliance on mirroring and mentalizing mechanisms mediating action understanding. Overall, inferring information about others’ actions involves activation of the mirror neuron system and theory-of-mind regions, and this activation (and the synchrony between activated brain regions) appears altered in young adults with ASD.","The authors would like to thank Dr Marie Moore Channell, and Patrick Powell for their help at different stages of this study.

Studies report that endocrine disrupting compounds (EDCs), including polychlorinated biphenyls, organochlorine pesticides, perfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS), and some metals, have adverse effects on the fetal neurodevelopment. The aim of this study was to measure the amniotic fluid (AF) levels of EDCs and metals as well as the receptor transactivities induced by AF and investigate the possible link between prenatal exposure to EDCs and heavy metals and ASD risk.MethodsIn this case-control study, we included AF samples of 75 ASD cases and 135 frequency-matched controls and measured the levels of the endogenous sex hormones, PFAS, and elements including heavy metals. The combined effect of endogenous hormones and EDCs on the receptor of estrogen (ER), androgen (AR), aryl hydrocarbon (AhR), and thyroid hormone-like activity were also determined and expressed as receptor ligand equivalents. We assessed the associations of AF levels of chemicals, sex hormones, and receptor activities with ASD risk using unconditional logistical regression analyses. To control for multiple comparisons, the false discovery rate (FDR) was used and q values less than 0.25 were designated as statistical significance.ResultsPFAS and metals were detectable in AF samples. The ASD cases had significantly lower AF levels of PFAS than controls, and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) was 0.410 (95% CI 0.174, 0.967; p = 0.042; FDR qvalue = 0.437) for perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS). The principal component, including PFAS congeners, copper, iron, and estrogenic activity, was significantly inversely associated with ASD risk (adjusted OR = 0.100; 95% CI 0.016, 0.630; p = 0.014; FDR qvalue = 0.098).Testosterone level in AF weakly associated with ASD risk (adjusted OR = 1.002; 95% CI 1.000, 1.004; p = 0.05). However, after multiple comparison correction, the association was not significant (FDR qvalue = 0.437). No significant associations between AF-induced receptor transactivities and ASD risk were observed. The adjusted OR was 2.176 (95%CI 0.115, 41.153) for the ratio of the combined androgenic activity to combined estrogenic activity.ConclusionsThe presence of PFAS and heavy metals in AF indicates that they can cross the placenta. The inverse association between levels of PFAS congeners in AF and ASD risk might relate to the weak estrogenic activities and anti-androgenic activities of PFAS.The observed tendency of positive association between the ratio of combined androgenic effect to the combined estrogenic effect and ASD risk needs further studies to explore whether EDCs together with endogenous hormones play a role in the development of ASD.","We thank members of the Centre for Arctic Health &amp; Molecular Epidemiology research group, especially Tanja Krüger for technical and scientific support regarding the AR transactivation assay and Dorte Olsson for technical assistance.

We report a preregistered experiment that examines how adults with and without ASD process counterfactual emotions in real-time, based on research showing that the developmental trajectory of counterfactual thinking may be disrupted in people with ASD. Participants were eye-tracked as they read narratives in which a character made an explicit decision then subsequently experienced either a mildly negative or positive outcome. The final sentence in each story included an explicit remark about the character's mood that was either consistent or inconsistent with the character's expected feelings of regret or relief (e.g., ""… she feels happy/annoyed about her decision.""). Results showed that adults with ASD are unimpaired in processing emotions based on counterfactual reasoning, and in fact showed earlier sensitivity to inconsistencies within relief contexts compared to TD participants. This finding highlights a previously unknown strength in empathy and emotion processing in adults with ASD, which may have been masked in previous research that has typically relied on explicit, response-based measures to record emotional inferences, which are likely to be susceptible to demand characteristics and response biases. Therefore, this study highlights the value of employing implicit measures that provide insights on peoples' immediate responses to emotional content without disrupting ongoing processing.

However, sampling from online channels may be associated with a high risk of sampling bias causing findings not to be generalizable to the autism population. Here we examined autism studies that have sampled on social media for markers of sampling bias. Most samples showed one or more indicators of sampling bias, in the form of reversed sex ratio, higher employment rates, higher education level, lower fraction of individuals with intellectual disability, and later age of diagnosis than would be expected when comparing with for example population study results from published research. Findings from many of the included studies are therefore difficult to generalize to the broader autism population. Suggestions for how research strategies may be adapted to address some of the problems are discussed. LAY SUMMARY: Online surveys offer a convenient way to recruit large numbers of participants for autism research. However, the resulting samples may not fully reflect the autism population. Here we investigated the samples of 36 autism studies that recruited participants online and found that the demographic composition tended to deviate from what has been reported about the autism population in previous research. The results may thus not be generalizable to autism in general.","Kamilla Woznica Miskowiak is supported by the Lundbeck Foundation and the Weimann Foundation.

However, little is known about what is happening in people's brains when self-regulation is impaired in young people with ASD. We used a technique called functional MRI (which measures brain activity by detecting changes associated with blood flow) at a resting state (when participants are not asked to do anything) to research this in intellectually able young people with ASD. We found that brains with more connections, especially between regions involved in sensorimotor processing and regions involved in the processes that enable peoples to focus their attention on the most pertinent features from the sensory environment (salience processing), were related to more impaired self-regulation in young people with and without ASD. We also found that impaired self-regulation was related to increased communication within the brain system involved in voluntary orienting attention to a sensory cue (the dorsal attention network) in young people with ASD. These results highlight how different people have different degrees of dysregulation, which has been largely overlooked in the earlier brain imaging reports on ASD.

Delay in recognition of symptoms and help seeking due to lack of awareness and access to proper medical care and prevalent false beliefs were the leading reason for late diagnosis of CP in Nepal and thus children loose valuable time for intervention in their early developmental stage.,,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Adult; Cerebral Palsy; Child; Child, Preschool; Cross-Sectional Studies; Delayed Diagnosis; Female; Humans; Male; Movement Disorders; Nepal; Parents; Physicians; Prevalence; Prospective Studies; Time-to-Treatment",15/03/2017,2017,15/03/2017,2017-06,47,6,1739-1748,Closed,Article,"Thapa, Ritesh","Thapa, Ritesh (Self-help Group for Cerebral Palsy, Lalitpur, Nepal)","Thapa, Ritesh ","Thapa, Ritesh ()",,,,,3,1,0.32,1,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084026969,42 Health Sciences; 4201 Allied Health and Rehabilitation Science; 4203 Health Services and Systems,,No,,,

We hypothesized that GABAA receptor binding potential (GABAA R BPND ) would correlate with cortical thickness, but their correlations would differ between autistic adults and typically developing (TD) controls. We studied 50 adults (23 autism, 27 TD, mean age of 27 years) using magnetic resonance imaging to measure cortical thickness, and [18 F]flumazenil positron emission tomography imaging to measure GABAA R BPND . We determined the correlations between cortical thickness and GABAA R BPND by cortical lobe, region-of-interest, and diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We also explored potential sex differences in the relationship between cortical thickness and autism characteristics, as measured by autism spectrum quotient (AQ) scores. Comparing autism and TD groups, no significant differences were found in cortical thickness or GABAA R BPND . In both autism and TD groups, a negative relationship between cortical thickness and GABAA R BPND was observed in the frontal and occipital cortices, but no relationship was found in the temporal or limbic cortices. A positive correlation was seen in the parietal cortex that was only significant for the autism group. Interestingly, in an exploratory analysis, we found sex differences in the relationships between cortical thickness and GABAA R BPND , and cortical thickness and AQ scores in the left postcentral gyrus. LAY SUMMARY: The thickness of the brain cortex and the density of the receptors associated with inhibitory neurotransmitter GABA have been hypothesized to underlie the neurobiology of autism. In this study, we found that these biomarkers correlate positively in the parietal cortex, but negatively in the frontal and occipital cortical regions of the brain. Furthermore, we collected preliminary evidence that the correlations between cortical thickness and GABA receptor density are sexdependent in a brain region where sensory inputs are registered.","This research was funded by the Stanford Medical Scholars Research Program (to David James), the National Institute of Mental Health (K08MH111750 awarded to Lawrence K.

We systematically reviewed evidence from observational studies on the associations between autism spectrum disorders (ASD) and early-life antibiotic exposure. Eleven articles were included in the review. Prenatal antibiotic exposure was associated with a slightly increased risk of ASD in two cohort studies on overlapping populations and in one case–control study; in three other case–control studies, no significant association was found. One cohort study found a slightly reduced risk of ASD after postnatal antibiotic exposure, while two other cohort studies on overlapping populations and three case–control studies reported an increased risk. Meta-analysis of the eligible studies showed no significant associations. Current data are conflicting and do not conclusively support the hypothesis that early-life antibiotic exposure is associated with subsequent ASD development.","Ruth Baron: Sarphati Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Isolde Besseling-van der Vaart: Sarphati Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Dorota Gieruszczak-Białek: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Andrea Horvath: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Jan Łukasik: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Maciej Kołodziej: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Bernadeta Patro-Gołąb: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Małgorzata Pieścik-Lech: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Jaap Seidell: Sarphati Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Agata Skórka: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Hania Szajewska: Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091 Warsaw, Poland, Meron Taye: Sarphati Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Joanne Ujcic: Sarphati Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands, Arnoud Verhoeff: Sarphati Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Anti-Bacterial Agents; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Cohort Studies; Female; Humans; Observational Studies as Topic; Pregnancy,08/06/2019,2019,08/06/2019,2019-09,49,9,3866-3876,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Łukasik, Jan; Patro-Gołąb, Bernadeta; Horvath, Andrea; Baron, Ruth; Szajewska, Hania","Łukasik, Jan (Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091, Warsaw, Poland); Patro-Gołąb, Bernadeta (Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091, Warsaw, Poland); Horvath, Andrea (Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091, Warsaw, Poland); Baron, Ruth (Sarphati Amsterdam, Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Szajewska, Hania (Department of Paediatrics, The Medical University of Warsaw, Żwirki i Wigury 63A, 02-091, Warsaw, Poland)","Szajewska, Hania (Medical University of Warsaw)","Łukasik, Jan (Medical University of Warsaw); Patro-Gołąb, Bernadeta (Medical University of Warsaw); Horvath, Andrea (Medical University of Warsaw); Baron, Ruth (); Szajewska, Hania (Medical University of Warsaw)",Medical University of Warsaw,grid.13339.3b,Poland,,22,15,1.13,5.97,23,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10803-019-04093-y.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1116997492,42 Health Sciences; 4202 Epidemiology,,No,,,

Language skills vary enormously in autism: while some autistic individuals can engage in sophisticated conversations, many remain minimally verbal, meaning they use few or no words regularly for communication. We do not know what causes this variation, but we do know that certain child and family characteristics can be measured when a child is young, and this information can improve our prediction of how expressive language might develop over time. What this article adds? We examined four characteristics, which have already been found to predict language development in young minimally verbal autistic children. We followed the expressive language progress of 27 minimally verbal children, aged three to five, for a year. One-third no longer met the minimally verbal criteria at the end of the study. In this sample, only one factor predicted language progress, which was the child's initial speech skills (the number of different speech sounds that the child made during an interaction). This finding adds to the evidence that speech skills contribute to language development in autism. In some cases, persistent and severe expressive language difficulties may reflect an additional deficit in speech production, rather than a consequence of core autism features. Implications for practice, research or policy Our findings suggest that there are factors other than social skills that influence language development in autism. Careful assessment of speech production should be considered when language does not develop as expected. Future research should evaluate speech skills interventions for minimally verbal autistic individuals, as well as promoting the use of alternative communication systems.","Thanks to Dr John Swettenham for reviewing a draft of this manuscript, and to the families who took part in this study.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Humans; Language Development Disorders; Phonetics; Speech,21/01/2020,2020,21/01/2020,2020-07,24,5,1217-1231,All OA; Green,Article,"Saul, Jo; Norbury, Courtenay","Saul, Jo (University College London, UK); Norbury, Courtenay (University College London, UK)","Saul, Jo (University College London)","Saul, Jo (University College London); Norbury, Courtenay (University College London)",University College London,grid.83440.3b,United Kingdom,Economic and Social Research Council,19,17,5.68,9.83,22,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10095078/1/Saul_Norbury_Autism_2020.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124238061,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,Yes,https://osf.io/x2wcg,Observational ,

Most dietary studies have been limited by small sample sizes and rarely assess the heterogeneity of autism. Addressing this gap, this study compared the anthropometrics, dietary composition, dietary quality, and food variety of 154 Australian children and adolescents on the spectrum and 213 non-autistic children (71 siblings and 142 unrelated controls). Beyond the case-control approach, within-group comparisons assessed the influence of autism clinical presentations and sensory processing styles on body mass index (BMI) and measures of dietary intake among those on the spectrum. In this word first study of diet that included between-group comparisons with non-autistic peers (siblings and an unrelated comparison group) and within-autism group comparisons, we found that children on the spectrum consumed limited variety and lower quality of food and non-autistic siblings also ate comparably higher levels of energy-dense, nutrient poor food, and less diary. This may be due to autistic traits influencing family's diets or shared sensory sensitivities driving dietary intake. Within the autism group, higher autistic traits were associated with lower BMIs and a specific dietary pattern higher in simple carbohydrates and lower in unprocessed protein. Contrastingly, greater sensitivity to sensory stimuli was associated with a healthier diet. Increased age was linked to more varied diets but also diets higher in saturated fats and energy-dense, nutrient poor foods. Overall, this research highlights that potential mediators of dietary intake, such as familial influences, autistic traits, sensory processing styles, age and sex, need to be considered when assessing diet in the autistic population. LAY SUMMARY: In this study of dietary differences linked to autism, children, and teenagers on the spectrum ate fewer different foods and were less likely to eat recommended amounts of fruits and vegetables when compared to non-autistic siblings and unrelated children and teenagers. There were also family differences, in that those on the spectrum and their siblings ate more unhealthy foods and less dairy. Among those on the spectrum, dietary differences were linked to age, sex, autistic traits and sensory processing styles.","The authors are indebted to all the children, parents and carers who participated in the Australian Autism Biobank and the Dietary Intake Study in cHildren (DISH).

This study utilized an age- and IQ-matched sample of school-aged youth (n = 228) diagnosed with ASD to assess sex differences on the ADOS and ADI-R, parent-reported autistic traits, and adaptive skills. Although females and males were rated similarly on gold-standard diagnostic measures overall, females with higher IQs were less likely to meet criteria on the ADI-R. Females were also found to be significantly more impaired on parent reported autistic traits and adaptive skills.

Imaging genetic animal models that recapitulate a mutation associated with autism quantify the impact of genetics on brain morphology and mitigate the confounding factors in human studies. Here, we used MRI to image three genetic mouse models with single mutations implicated in autism: Neuroligin-3 R451C knock-in, Methyl-CpG binding protein-2 (MECP2) 308-truncation and integrin β3 homozygous knockout. This study identified the morphological differences specific to the cerebellum, a structure repeatedly linked to autism in human neuroimaging and postmortem studies. To accomplish a comparative analysis, a segmented cerebellum template was created and used to segment each study image. This template delineated 39 different cerebellar structures. For Neuroligin-3 R451C male mutants, the gray (effect size (ES) = 1.94, FDR q = 0.03) and white (ES = 1.84, q = 0.037) matter of crus II lobule and the gray matter of the paraflocculus (ES = 1.45, q = 0.045) were larger in volume. The MECP2 mutant mice had cerebellar volume changes that increased in scope depending on the genotype: hemizygous males to homozygous females. The integrin β3 mutant mouse had a drastically smaller cerebellum than controls with 28 out of 39 cerebellar structures smaller. These imaging results are discussed in relation to repetitive behaviors, sociability, and learning in the context of autism. This work further illuminates the cerebellum's role in autism.","The authors would like to thank Dr. James Ellis for contributing the MECP2 mice used in this study.

This is also true for parent training programmes for families of autistic children. An evaluation was conducted to understand the effects of a short-term intensive parent training programme delivered in routine services for families of autistic children in China. This study reported results from the in-depth interviews with 14 participating caregivers and group discussions with eight group leaders. The interviews and discussions were aimed at learning (1) to what extent the programme components were deemed acceptable, (2) what affected caregivers' attendance and engagement in the programme and (3) what affected group leaders' delivery of the programme. Findings suggested that future parent training programmes provide adequate opportunities for caregivers to practice and receive feedback; group support; coaching experience tailored to individual challenges; more autism-related knowledge, resources and activities for children and extended family members; and organisational support to group leaders. This study highlights the value of qualitative research and points to the need for more empirical studies to address the recommendations, so that research findings can be better utilised to promote practices.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Child; Humans; Autistic Disorder; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Family; Caregivers; Parents,24/01/2022,2022,24/01/2022,2022-11,26,8,1973-1986,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Fang, Zuyi; Lachman, Jamie M; Zhang, Cheng; Qiao, Dongping; Barlow, Jane","Fang, Zuyi (Beijing Normal University, China); Lachman, Jamie M (University of Oxford, UK; University of Glasgow, UK); Zhang, Cheng (University of Leeds, UK); Qiao, Dongping (Beijing Normal University, China); Barlow, Jane (University of Oxford, UK)","Fang, Zuyi (Beijing Normal University)","Fang, Zuyi (Beijing Normal University); Lachman, Jamie M (University of Oxford; University of Glasgow); Zhang, Cheng (University of Leeds); Qiao, Dongping (Beijing Normal University); Barlow, Jane (University of Oxford)",University of Oxford; University of Glasgow; Beijing Normal University; University of Leeds,grid.4991.5; grid.8756.c; grid.20513.35; grid.9909.9,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; China; United Kingdom,Chief Scientist Office; Medical Research Council,1,1,,,1,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/13623613211070869,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1144940718,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,No,,,

To expand intervention options, it is crucial to gain a better understanding of potential treatment targets, and their engagement, in the brain. For instance, the striatum (caudate, putamen, and nucleus accumbens) plays a central role during development and its (atypical) functional connectivity (FC) may contribute to multiple ASD symptoms. We have previously shown, in the adult autistic and neurotypical brain, the non-intoxicating cannabinoid cannabidivarin (CBDV) alters the balance of striatal ‘excitatory–inhibitory’ metabolites, which help regulate FC, but the effects of CBDV on (atypical) striatal FC are unknown.MethodsTo examine this in a small pilot study, we acquired resting state functional magnetic resonance imaging data from 28 men (15 neurotypicals, 13 ASD) on two occasions in a repeated-measures, double-blind, placebo-controlled study. We then used a seed-based approach to (1) compare striatal FC between groups and (2) examine the effect of pharmacological probing (600 mg CBDV/matched placebo) on atypical striatal FC in ASD. Visits were separated by at least 13 days to allow for drug washout.ResultsCompared to the neurotypicals, ASD individuals had lower FC between the ventral striatum and frontal and pericentral regions (which have been associated with emotion, motor, and vision processing). Further, they had higher intra-striatal FC and higher putamenal FC with temporal regions involved in speech and language. In ASD, CBDV reduced hyperconnectivity to the neurotypical level.LimitationsOur findings should be considered in light of several methodological aspects, in particular our participant group (restricted to male adults), which limits the generalizability of our findings to the wider and heterogeneous ASD population.ConclusionIn conclusion, here we show atypical striatal FC with regions commonly associated with ASD symptoms. We further provide preliminary proof of concept that, in the adult autistic brain, acute CBDV administration can modulate atypical striatal circuitry towards neurotypical function. Future studies are required to determine whether modulation of striatal FC is associated with a change in ASD symptoms.Trial registrationclinicaltrials.gov, Identifier: NCT03537950.

Although individuals with neurodevelopmental disabilities are given some priority in Israel, it is unclear to what extent individuals with ASD are being vaccinated relative to that of the general population. This study was aimed to assess vaccination prevalence among individuals with ASD.
METHOD: Individuals with ASD, and age- and sex-matched controls (total n = 11,080), were assessed for prevalence of COVID-19 vaccination by February 2021, approximately a month and a half after the national vaccination distribution plan was launched in Israel. Data were obtained from the database of Clalit Health Services (CHS), the largest healthcare organization in Israel.
RESULTS: Individuals with ASD were more likely to be vaccinated for COVID-19 (OR = 2.55, 95 %CI 2.35-2.75, p < .001) across both sexes, but only in the 16-20 (OR = 2.04, 95 %CI 1.79-2.32, p < .001) and 21-40 (OR = 3.95, 95 %CI 3.52-4.43, p < .001) age groups. After adjusting for chronic illnesses, ASD remained significant in predicting the uptake of COVID-19 vaccination.
CONCLUSIONS: Efforts to prioritize ASD patients may improve vaccination prevalence among individuals with ASD, especially among younger individuals. Healthcare providers worldwide should therefore consider prioritization policies so as to increase vaccination rates among this vulnerable population.","The authors would like to thank Amit Nachman, Doron Comantscher, Idan Gabay, Seffy Sobel Roytblat and Nir Ronen from Clalit Health Services, for their assistance with data extraction.

Data from 90 autistic and 30 typically developing children were analyzed. Results showed that autistic social subtypes varied in language skill problems (aloof > passive > active-but-odd). There was a negative association between aloof dimension scores and language performance but positive for the active-but-odd dimension and no association in the passive one. Moreover, aloof dimension score was the main contributor to language performance. A receiver operating characteristic analysis suggested language vocabulary as an additional component in differentiating autistic social subtypes. These findings demonstrate that variations in language skills in autistic children provide additional information for discriminating their social subtype.","This work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) [grant number 31,530,032 - KMK], Key Scientific and Technological projects of Guangdong Province [grant number 2018B030335001 - KMK], Beijing Municipal Science &amp; Technology Commission [grant number Z181100001518005- RZ], Key-Area Research and Development Program of Guangdong Province [grant number 2019B030335001-RZ], Fundamental Research Funds for the Central Universities, UESTC [grant number ZYGX2020J027 - WHZ] and by Natural Science Foundation of Sichuan Province [grant number 2022NSFSC1375 - WHZ].",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",,25/10/2022,2022,25/10/2022,25/10/2022,,,01-Dec,Closed,Article,"Zhao, Weihua; Li, Qin; Zhang, Xiaolu; Song, Xinwei; Zhu, Siyu; Shou, Xiaojing; Meng, Fanchao; Xu, Xinjie; Zhang, Rong; Kendrick, Keith M","Zhao, Weihua (MOE Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation of Ministry of Education, Center for Information in Medicine, The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 611731, Chengdu, China); Li, Qin (Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine, 611137, Chengdu, China); Zhang, Xiaolu (MOE Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation of Ministry of Education, Center for Information in Medicine, The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 611731, Chengdu, China); Song, Xinwei (MOE Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation of Ministry of Education, Center for Information in Medicine, The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 611731, Chengdu, China); Zhu, Siyu (MOE Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation of Ministry of Education, Center for Information in Medicine, The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 611731, Chengdu, China); Shou, Xiaojing (Neuroscience Research Institute, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ministry of Education of China, National Committee of Health and Family Planning of China, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China); Meng, Fanchao (Neuroscience Research Institute, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ministry of Education of China, National Committee of Health and Family Planning of China, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China); Xu, Xinjie (Neuroscience Research Institute, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ministry of Education of China, National Committee of Health and Family Planning of China, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China); Zhang, Rong (Neuroscience Research Institute, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Key Laboratory for Neuroscience, Department of Neurobiology, School of Basic Medical Sciences, Ministry of Education of China, National Committee of Health and Family Planning of China, Peking University, 100191, Beijing, China); Kendrick, Keith M (MOE Key Laboratory for NeuroInformation of Ministry of Education, Center for Information in Medicine, The Clinical Hospital of Chengdu Brain Science Institute, University of Electronic Science and Technology of China, 611731, Chengdu, China)","Zhang, Rong ; Kendrick, Keith M (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China)","Zhao, Weihua (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Li, Qin (Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine); Zhang, Xiaolu (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Song, Xinwei (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Zhu, Siyu (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China); Shou, Xiaojing (); Meng, Fanchao (); Xu, Xinjie (); Zhang, Rong (); Kendrick, Keith M (University of Electronic Science and Technology of China)",Chengdu University of Traditional Chinese Medicine; University of Electronic Science and Technology of China,grid.411304.3; grid.54549.39,China; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China; Guangdong Science and Technology Department; Beijing Municipal Science & Technology Commision,0,0,,,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1152168043,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,Open Data

While a number of structural and functional neuroimaging methods have been used to explore the brain differences in ASD with regards to speech and language comprehension and production, the neurobiology of basic speech function in ASD has not been examined. Magnetoencephalography (MEG) is a neuroimaging modality with high spatial and temporal resolution that can be applied to the examination of brain dynamics underlying speech as it can capture the fast responses fundamental to this function. We acquired MEG from 21 children with high-functioning autism (mean age: 11.43 years) and 21 age- and sex-matched controls as they performed a simple oromotor task, a phoneme production task and a phonemic sequencing task. Results showed significant differences in activation magnitude and peak latencies in primary motor cortex (Brodmann Area 4), motor planning areas (BA 6), temporal sequencing and sensorimotor integration areas (BA 22/13) and executive control areas (BA 9). Our findings of significant functional brain differences between these two groups on these simple oromotor and phonemic tasks suggest that these deficits may be foundational and could underlie the language deficits seen in ASD.","This study was completed by Tatiana Valica in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree of Master of Science from the University of Toronto.

Our previous PASS intervention, delivered by community based lay health workers, showed effectiveness. This article reports the development and evaluation of a new ""PASS 'Plus'"" intervention in a rural population in India. Using formative research methods, we supplemented the PASS intervention with additional (Plus) modules to address autism comorbidities. This is the first time that a rigorous methodology has been used to evaluate autism symptom outcomes in a low and middle-income country setting. 40 parent-child dyads were recruited in a pilot randomized controlled trial against usual care (mean age 65 months (34 boys); n = 19 PASS Plus, n = 21 UC). 89% of intervention families partially or entirely completed the 12-session intervention. Intention to treat analysis showed a reduction in mean scores of autism symptom severity, though the confidence interval contains zero, (adjusted mean difference AMD -2.42 95% CI -7.75, 2.92; ES 0.22); large treatment effects on proximal outcomes of proportion of parent synchronous responses (AMD 0.35; 95% CI 0.18, 0.52; effect size ES 3.97) and proportion of child communication initiations with parent (AMD 0·17; 95% CI 0.03, 0.32; ES 1.02). Confidence intervals for effects on mutual shared attention (AMD 0.10; 95% CI -0.07, 0.27; ES 0.5) and co-morbid symptoms (AMD -9.0; 95% CI -24.26, 6.26; ES 0.32) contained zero.

Of 126 charts reviewed, 49% (n = 62) had intellectual disability, 49% (n = 62) had attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, 52% (n = 65) had anxiety, 41% (n = 52) had obesity, 31% (n = 39) with a history of aggressive behavior, 31% (n = 31) had depression, 22% (n = 28) had seizures, and 9% (n = 11) had hypertension. A Medical Regimen Complexity Index score was determined to examine medication use trends in the autism spectrum disorder population. Medical Regimen Complexity Index scores were significantly higher for patients with intellectual disability, patients with seizures, and patients with a history of aggressive behavior. Both the focus group and our pre-visit assessment identified the waiting room and waiting time as barriers to care. Understanding the comorbidities, polypharmacy, and medical barriers should provide a better understanding of the current health care access and delivery needs of adolescents and adults with autism spectrum disorder.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Female; Focus Groups; Health Services Accessibility; Health Services Needs and Demand; Humans; Male; Needs Assessment; Primary Health Care; Retrospective Studies; Transition to Adult Care; Young Adult,28/07/2017,2017,28/07/2017,2018-01,22,1,51-61,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Saqr, Youssra; Braun, Erika; Porter, Kyle; Barnette, Debra; Hanks, Christopher","Saqr, Youssra (The Ohio State University, USA); Braun, Erika (The Ohio State University, USA); Porter, Kyle (The Ohio State University, USA); Barnette, Debra (The Ohio State University, USA); Hanks, Christopher (The Ohio State University, USA)","Hanks, Christopher (The Ohio State University)","Saqr, Youssra (The Ohio State University); Braun, Erika (The Ohio State University); Porter, Kyle (The Ohio State University); Barnette, Debra (The Ohio State University); Hanks, Christopher (The Ohio State University)",The Ohio State University,grid.261331.4,United States,,62,34,5.03,12.34,10,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361317709970,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1090917573,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,No,,,

One way to manage this risk may be for parents to use techniques taught in Improving Parents as Communication Teachers (ImPACT) with the younger siblings during the period in which language delay and ASD may be too subtle to be diagnosed. ImPACT targets children's play, imitation, and communication skills. Improvement in these skills may reduce the severity of language delays and social communication deficits associated with ASD. In this study, 97 younger siblings of children with ASD and their primary parents were randomly assigned to ImPACT or a control group. We measured whether parents used ImPACT teaching strategies and whether children used the skills that ImPACT targets. We also measured children's later language ability and social communication skills. The results confirmed our predictions that parents' use of ImPACT strategies improves language ability by improving children's motor imitation and communication skills. Use of ImPACT also had a positive effect on children's language delay and ASD symptoms, supporting the clinical value of the findings. The study's methodological strengths make this one of the most rigorous tests of ImPACT and supports one way to manage the risk of language delay and ASD in younger siblings of children with ASD.","We are grateful to the skillful and conscientious work of our staff: Catherine Bush, Elizabeth Gardner, Cassandra Newsom, Amy Nicholson, Jessica Buenahora, Heather Redix, Katherine Ragsdale, Kathryn Coddington, Danielle Trzil, Sonja Kottke, Karen Bearss, Courtney Froehlig, Veronica Kang, Shanni Geller, Allycen Kurup, Hailee Hannah, Rachel Hantman, Colleen Harker, Elizabeth Karp, and Catherine Dick.

One recent avenue of research has focused on caregiver’s concern, suggesting that autism might present differently in boys and girls. One unexplored factor related to concerns on child development is whether socio-cultural factors such as gender-related expectations influence the evaluation of symptom severity and predictions about future behavioral development.MethodsThe latter concerns were the focus of the present study and were explored by investigating laypeople’s judgment of the severity of autism symptoms using an online parent role-playing paradigm, in which participants were asked to rate vignettes depicting the behaviors of a child in different everyday life scenarios. The child’s gender and the severity of ASD symptoms were manipulated to examine the effect of gender on the perception of symptom severity.ResultsResults suggest that there are no gender differences in perceived symptom severity and associated degree of concern for 5-year-old boys and girls but that there is a gender difference in perceived future atypicality at 15 years old, with boys being rated as more likely to be perceived as atypical by their peers at that age than girls.ConclusionsInvestigating parent’s cognition about their child’s future behavioral development can provide additional information regarding delayed diagnosis of autistic girls.",We were able to conduct the present study thanks to the F.R.S.-FNRS Research Incentive Grant F.4502.15 to Mikhail Kissine and a Foundation Jean-François Peterbroeck doctoral grant to Philippine Geelhand.

Students with Autism Spectrum Disorder may be vulnerable during transition however little is known about how Autism Spectrum (AS) traits influence transition outcomes. Generalised estimating equations were used to examine how AS traits were associated with four indicators of successful transition in a school-based sample of 51 students. Higher AS traits were associated with lower quality of life, school belonging and mental health, however the hypothesised decline after school transition was not supported. Characteristics of both the primary and secondary school appeared to be contributing to the wellbeing of students with high AS traits which could be clarified by further investigation with a larger sample.",This paper formed part of a doctoral thesis for Moira Whelan.

To further investigate this, the adolescent/adult sensory profile (AASP) questionnaire was distributed to 85 parents of typically developing children (P-TD), 121 parents from simplex ASD families (SPX), and 54 parents from multiplex ASD families (MPX). After controlling for gender and presence of mental disorders, results showed that MPX parents significantly differed from P-TD parents in all four subscales of the AASP. Differences between SPX and MPX parents reached significance in the Sensory Sensitivity subscale and also in subsequent modality-specific analyses in the auditory and visual domains. Our finding that parents with high genetic liability for ASD (i.e., MPX) had more sensory processing atypicalities than parents with low (i.e., SPX) or no (i.e., P-TD) ASD genetic liability suggests that sensory processing atypicalities may contribute to the genetic susceptibility for ASD.","This research was supported by a Fulbright Scholarship to CD.

Researchers perceive difficulties around compliance with instructions, testing, challenging behaviours and family stress. Although research with these children can indeed be difficult, their continuing exclusion is unethical and unacceptable. Drawing on our experiences testing a possible treatment for children with profound autism, we provide 10 practical guidelines related to (1) interacting physically, (2) combining play and testing, (3) responding to challenging behaviour, (4) finding suitable tests, (5) relationships with parents, (6) relationships with siblings, (7) involving stakeholders, (8) planning the testing times, (9) the role of the clinical supervisor and (10) recruiting and retaining participants. We hope that these guidelines will prepare and embolden other research teams to work with profoundly autistic children, ending their historical exclusion from research. These guidelines also could be useful for conducting research with children with intellectual disabilities.","The authors thank the families who took part in our clinical trial.

Multi-level modelling revealed a large overall effect, Hedges’ g = 1.16, with significant heterogeneity across participant, treatment, and study levels. Further, a more appropriate model using between-case estimation for within-subject effects to improve comparability between single-case and group-design studies, yielded a smaller but still significant effect, g = 0.51. Lastly, higher exercise intensity, but not age, exercise duration or settings, reliably predicted treatment effectiveness.

We examined premature mortality in autistic males and females (assigned at birth) in a population-based cohort, compared to males and females with and without other developmental disabilities. Using linked administrative health and social services population data from Ontario, Canada, age-matched males and females aged 19-65 years were followed between 2010 and 2016, and causes of death were determined. Over the 6-year observation period, 330 of 42,607 persons (0.77%) in the group without developmental disabilities had died compared to 259 of 10,646 persons (2.43%) in the autism group and 419 of 10,615 persons (3.95%) in the other developmental disabilities group. Autistic males and females were more likely to die than non-autistic males (adjusted risk ratio, RR 3.13, 95%CI 2.58-3.79) and non-autistic females (adjusted RR 3.12, 95%CI 2.35-4.13) without developmental disabilities, but were less likely to die than adults with other developmental disabilities (males: adjusted RR 0.66, 95%CI 0.55-0.79; females: adjusted RR 0.55, 95%CI 0.43-0.71). Most common causes of death varied depending on a person's sex and diagnosis. Given the greater likelihood of premature mortality in adults with developmental disabilities including autism, greater attention and resources directed toward their health and social care are needed, tailored to their sex and diagnosis-informed needs. LAY SUMMARY: This study looked at how many autistic men and women died over 6 years (2010-2016), along with how they died, and compared this to adults who did not have autism living in Ontario, Canada. It found that autistic men and women were more than three times as likely to die as people of the same age who did not have a developmental disability. However, adults with other developmental disabilities besides autism were even more likely to die than autistic adults. This means that we have to pay more attention and invest in better social and health care for autistic people, along with people who have other types of developmental disabilities.","This study is part of the Health Care Access Research and Developmental Disabilities Program (www.hcardd.ca).

Following PRISMA structure, a comprehensive literature research was conducted in five electronic indexing databases: Central, PubMed, Medline, Web of Science and Scopus. Six studies between 2005 and 2019 were included and seven standardized instruments have been analyzed. All instruments present some evidence of validity and reliability, but none reported responsiveness. The instruments reviewed were not used for their original purpose, which may explain the results. The small number of studies prevent drawing clear conclusions. Future studies should focus on appropriate, valid, reliable, and responsive measures. Research focusing on psychometric properties is crucial, mostly about responsiveness.","This work was supported by the European Regional Development Fund (ERDF) under Grant POCI-01-0145-FEDER-007746 funded by the Operational Programme Competitiveness and Internationalization–COMPETE2020 and by the national funds through FCT–Fundação para a Ciência e a Tecnologia, I.P., within CINTESIS, R&amp;D Unit (reference UIDB/4255/2020 and UIDP/4255/2020), CLUL (reference UIDB/00214/2020) and a PhD Grant (reference 2020.08569.BD).",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",,24/02/2022,2022,24/02/2022,24/02/2022,,,Jan-17,Closed,Article,"Pereira, Tatiana; Lousada, Marisa","Pereira, Tatiana (Center for Health Technology and Services Research (CINTESIS.UA), Aveiro, Portugal; Center of Linguistics of the University of Lisbon (CLUL), Lisbon, Portugal; University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal; University of Aveiro, Campus Universitário de Santiago, 3810-193, Aveiro, Portugal); Lousada, Marisa (Center for Health Technology and Services Research (CINTESIS.UA), Aveiro, Portugal; Center of Linguistics of the University of Lisbon (CLUL), Lisbon, Portugal; School of Health Sciences (ESSUA), University of Aveiro, Aveiro, Portugal)","Pereira, Tatiana (; University of Lisbon; University of Aveiro; University of Aveiro)","Pereira, Tatiana (University of Lisbon; University of Aveiro; University of Aveiro); Lousada, Marisa (University of Lisbon; University of Aveiro)",University of Aveiro; University of Lisbon,grid.7311.4; grid.9983.b,Portugal; Portugal,European Commission; Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia,0,0,,,3,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1145817396,39 Education; 42 Health Sciences; 52 Psychology,,No,,,

This study aimed to examine the feasibility of delivering a parenting program in existing services, and the feasibility of conducting a future large-scale Randomized Controlled Trial evaluation of the effectiveness of the intervention. Parents of children aged 3-8 years with a diagnosis of ASD, or strongly suspected ASD were eligible to participate. A multicenter, pragmatic, feasibility randomized controlled trial was conducted in four specialist children's services in Wales. Families were randomly assigned to receive the Incredible Years® Autism Spectrum and Language Delays (IY-ASLD) parent program immediately or to a wait-list, treatment as usual control condition. IY-ASLD sessions were delivered once a week for 12 weeks. The primary outcomes related to feasibility (recruitment, retention, fidelity, and acceptability). Preliminary outcome analyses were conducted using covariance models controlling for study site and baseline scores. From October 5 to December 19, 2016, 58 families were randomized, 29 to IY-ASLD and 29 to control. Three parents did not attend any sessions while 19 (73%) completed the program. Fidelity of delivery was high (88%), as was satisfaction with the program. Fifty-three (91%) completed the follow-up measures. All 95% CIs for effect sizes included zero in exploratory outcome analyses. This study supports the feasibility of delivering the IY-ASLD in existing services with good levels of acceptability and fidelity evident. A larger randomized controlled trial is required to examine the effectiveness of the program. Autism Res 2020, 13: 1011-1022. © 2020 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

The success of this approach is governed by the underlying effect sizes carried by the true risk variants and the corresponding statistical power to observe such effects given the study design and sample size under investigation. Previous ASD GWAS have identified genome-wide significant (GWS) risk loci; however, these studies were of only of low statistical power to identify GWS loci at the lower effect sizes (odds ratio (OR) <1.15).MethodsWe conducted a large-scale coordinated international collaboration to combine independent genotyping data to improve the statistical power and aid in robust discovery of GWS loci. This study uses genome-wide genotyping data from a discovery sample (7387 ASD cases and 8567 controls) followed by meta-analysis of summary statistics from two replication sets (7783 ASD cases and 11359 controls; and 1369 ASD cases and 137308 controls).ResultsWe observe a GWS locus at 10q24.32 that overlaps several genes including PITX3, which encodes a transcription factor identified as playing a role in neuronal differentiation and CUEDC2 previously reported to be associated with social skills in an independent population cohort. We also observe overlap with regions previously implicated in schizophrenia which was further supported by a strong genetic correlation between these disorders (Rg = 0.23; P = 9 × 10−6). We further combined these Psychiatric Genomics Consortium (PGC) ASD GWAS data with the recent PGC schizophrenia GWAS to identify additional regions which may be important in a common neurodevelopmental phenotype and identified 12 novel GWS loci. These include loci previously implicated in ASD such as FOXP1 at 3p13, ATP2B2 at 3p25.3, and a ‘neurodevelopmental hub’ on chromosome 8p11.23.ConclusionsThis study is an important step in the ongoing endeavour to identify the loci which underpin the common variant signal in ASD. In addition to novel GWS loci, we have identified a significant genetic correlation with schizophrenia and association of ASD with several neurodevelopmental-related genes such as EXT1, ASTN2, MACROD2, and HDAC4.","We would like to thank the families who participated in and contributed towards the many cohorts used in these studies. Secondly, this extensive international collaboration required the extended effort of many clinical and non-clinical scientists over many years, not all of whom are co-authors of this manuscript. Their collegial effort in supporting these collaborative efforts is essential in the continuing efforts to understanding the genetic architecture of ASD.

Case definition was if a doctor or health care professional had ever told parents that their child had ASD and/or ADHD. Data were collected in 2008/2009 for 14,043 children. 1.7 % of children were reported as having ASD (95 % CI 1.4–2.0) at mean age 7.2 years (SD = 0.2; range = 6.3–8.2). 1.4 % reportedly had ADHD (95 % CI 1.2–1.7), and 0.3 % had both ASD and ADHD (95 % CI 0.2–0.5). After adjusting for socio-economic disadvantage, only male sex (p < 0.001 for both conditions) and cognitive ability, p = 0.004 (ASD); p = 0.01 (ADHD) remained strongly associated. The observed prevalence of parent-reported ASD is high compared to earlier UK and US estimates.

Yet, barriers such as a shortage of trained professionals contribute to significant delays in service. The goal of this proof-of-concept study was to explore strategies that support timely and equitable deployment of ASD-specific interventions.MethodsThis 15-week, randomized proof-of-concept study explored the acceptability of a digital parent mediated intervention online reciprocal imitation training (RIT; a naturalistic developmental behavioral intervention) and compared it to a treatment as usual (TAU) control on parent and child outcomes. Eligible children were between 18 and 60 months, met the cutoff for ASD on the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-2nd Edition and demonstrate significant social imitation deficits. Primary outcomes include the acceptability of RIT (Scale of Treatment Perceptions) and the feasibility of the Online RIT digital intervention (online RIT attributes). Secondary outcomes included parent fidelity (RIT parent fidelity form) and parental self-efficacy (Early Intervention Parenting Self-Efficacy Scale). Exploratory outcome measures included child social communication (Social Communication Checklist), child imitation skills (Unstructured Imitation Assessment), and family quality of life (Beach Center Family Quality of Life Scale).ResultsTwenty participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion. The acceptability and feasibility of RIT and the Online RIT digital intervention were rated highly. Among the secondary outcomes, there were significant group differences in parent fidelity (p < .001) and self-efficacy (p = .029). On exploratory outcomes, there were group differences in child social communication (p = .048). There were no significant group differences in imitation ability (p = .05) or family quality of life (p = .22).LimitationsThere are several limitations with this study, including the small sample size as well as lack of data on enactment and website engagement. This study was not able to address questions related to which variables predict program engagement and treatment response, which will be critical for determining which families may benefit from such a stepped-care delivery model.ConclusionsOverall, the Online RIT program delivered in a stepped-care format shows strong acceptability and holds promise as an innovative delivery model.Trial registration ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT04467073.

Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) is widely used to infer tissue microstructure. However, due to its lack of specificity, the underlying pathology of reported differences in DTI measures in autism remains poorly understood. Herein, we applied neurite orientation dispersion and density imaging (NODDI) to quantify and define more specific causes of WM microstructural changes associated with autism in adults.MethodsNODDI (neurite density index [NDI], orientation dispersion index, and isotropic volume fraction [ISOVF]) and DTI (fractional anisotropy [FA], mean diffusivity [MD], axial diffusivity, and radial diffusivity [RD]) measures were compared between autism (N = 26; 19 males and 7 females; 32.93 ± 9.24 years old) and age- and sex-matched typically developing (TD; N = 25; 17 males and 8 females; 34.43 ± 9.02 years old) groups using tract-based spatial statistics and region-of-interest analyses. Linear discriminant analysis using leave-one-out cross-validation (LDA-LOOCV) was also performed to assess the discriminative power of diffusion measures in autism and TD.ResultsSignificantly lower NDI and higher ISOVF, suggestive of decreased neurite density and increased extracellular free-water, respectively, were demonstrated in the autism group compared with the TD group, mainly in commissural and long-range association tracts, but with distinct predominant sides. Consistent with previous reports, the autism group showed lower FA and higher MD and RD when compared with TD group. Notably, LDA-LOOCV suggests that NDI and ISOVF have relatively higher accuracy (82%) and specificity (NDI, 84%; ISOVF, 88%) compared with that of FA, MD, and RD (accuracy, 67–73%; specificity, 68–80%).LimitationsThe absence of histopathological confirmation limit the interpretation of our findings.ConclusionsOur results suggest that NODDI measures might be useful as imaging biomarkers to diagnose autism in adults and assess its behavioral characteristics. Furthermore, NODDI allows interpretation of previous findings on changes in WM diffusion tensor metrics in individuals with autism.",The authors would like to thank all the study participants.

These abnormalities may contribute to prominent and distressing sensory hypersensitivities in patients with fragile X syndrome (FXS). The current study investigated functional properties of auditory cortex using a sensory entrainment task in FXS.MethodsEEG recordings were obtained from 17 adolescents and adults with FXS and 17 age- and sex-matched healthy controls. Participants heard an auditory chirp stimulus generated using a 1000-Hz tone that was amplitude modulated by a sinusoid linearly increasing in frequency from 0–100 Hz over 2 s.ResultsSingle trial time-frequency analyses revealed decreased gamma band phase-locking to the chirp stimulus in FXS, which was strongly coupled with broadband increases in gamma power. Abnormalities in gamma phase-locking and power were also associated with theta-gamma amplitude-amplitude coupling during the pre-stimulus period and with parent reports of heightened sensory sensitivities and social communication deficits.ConclusionsThis represents the first demonstration of neural entrainment alterations in FXS patients and suggests that fast-spiking interneurons regulating synchronous high-frequency neural activity have reduced functionality. This reduced ability to synchronize high-frequency neural activity was related to the total power of background gamma band activity. These observations extend findings from fmr1 KO models of FXS, characterize a core pathophysiological aspect of FXS, and may provide a translational biomarker strategy for evaluating promising therapeutics.","The authors would like to thank Rachel Greene, Savanna Sablich, and Melanie Soilleux for aid in data collection.",Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Acoustic Stimulation; Adolescent; Adult; Auditory Cortex; Case-Control Studies; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Auditory; Female; Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein; Fragile X Syndrome; Gene Expression; Humans; Hyperkinesis; Interneurons; Male; Middle Aged; Mutation; Social Communication Disorder",07/06/2017,2017,07/06/2017,2017-12,8,1,22,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ethridge, Lauren E.; White, Stormi P.; Mosconi, Matthew W.; Wang, Jun; Pedapati, Ernest V.; Erickson, Craig A.; Byerly, Matthew J.; Sweeney, John A.","Ethridge, Lauren E.

In a previous double-blind randomized study, we have shown that the diuretic NKCC1 chloride importer antagonist bumetanide, that decreases (Cl-)i and reinforces GABAergic inhibition, reduces the severity of autism symptoms. Here, we report results from an open-label trial pilot study in which we used functional magnetic resonance imaging and neuropsychological testing to determine the effects of 10 months bumetanide treatment in adolescents and young adults with autism. We show that bumetanide treatment improves emotion recognition and enhances the activation of brain regions involved in social and emotional perception during the perception of emotional faces.

In magnetoencephalogram (MEG), spectrally complex periodic sounds trigger two continuous neural responses—the auditory steady state response (ASSR) and the sustained field (SF). It has been shown that the SF in neurotypical individuals is associated with low-level analysis of pitch in the ‘pitch processing center’ of the Heschl’s gyrus. Therefore, alternations in this auditory response may reflect atypical processing of vocal pitch. The SF, however, has never been studied in people with ASD.MethodsWe used MEG and individual brain models to investigate the ASSR and SF evoked by monaural 40 Hz click trains in boys with ASD (N = 35) and neurotypical (NT) boys (N = 35) aged 7–12-years.ResultsIn agreement with the previous research in adults, the cortical sources of the SF in children were located in the left and right Heschl’s gyri, anterolateral to those of the ASSR. In both groups, the SF and ASSR dominated in the right hemisphere and were higher in the hemisphere contralateral to the stimulated ear. The ASSR increased with age in both NT and ASD children and did not differ between the groups. The SF amplitude did not significantly change between the ages of 7 and 12 years. It was moderately attenuated in both hemispheres and was markedly delayed and displaced in the left hemisphere in boys with ASD. The SF delay in participants with ASD was present irrespective of their intelligence level and severity of autism symptoms.LimitationsWe did not test the language abilities of our participants. Therefore, the link between SF and processing of vocal pitch in children with ASD remains speculative.ConclusionChildren with ASD demonstrate atypical processing of spectrally complex periodic sound at the level of the core auditory cortex of the left-hemisphere. The observed neural deficit may contribute to speech perception difficulties experienced by children with ASD, including their poor perception and production of linguistic prosody.",We are grateful to Ilia A.

There is increasing evidence for a key role of the placenta in prenatal developmental programming, suggesting that the placenta may, in part, contribute to origins of neurodevelopmental outcomes.MethodsWe examined associations between placental transcriptomic and epigenomic profiles and assessed their ability to predict intellectual and social impairment at age 10 years in 379 children from the Extremely Low Gestational Age Newborn (ELGAN) cohort. Assessment of intellectual ability (IQ) and social function was completed with the Differential Ability Scales-II and Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), respectively. Examining IQ and SRS allows for studying ASD risk beyond the diagnostic criteria, as IQ and SRS are continuous measures strongly correlated with ASD. Genome-wide mRNA, CpG methylation and miRNA were assayeds with the Illumina Hiseq 2500, HTG EdgeSeq miRNA Whole Transcriptome Assay, and Illumina EPIC/850 K array, respectively. We conducted genome-wide differential analyses of placental mRNA, miRNA, and CpG methylation data. These molecular features were then integrated for a predictive analysis of IQ and SRS outcomes using kernel aggregation regression. We lastly examined associations between ASD and the multi-omic-predicted component of IQ and SRS.ResultsGenes with important roles in neurodevelopment and placental tissue organization were associated with intellectual and social impairment. Kernel aggregations of placental multi-omics strongly predicted intellectual and social function, explaining approximately 8% and 12% of variance in SRS and IQ scores via cross-validation, respectively. Predicted in-sample SRS and IQ showed significant positive and negative associations with ASD case–control status.LimitationsThe ELGAN cohort comprises children born pre-term, and generalization may be affected by unmeasured confounders associated with low gestational age. We conducted external validation of predictive models, though the sample size (N = 49) and the scope of the available out-sample placental dataset are limited. Further validation of the models is merited.ConclusionsAggregating information from biomarkers within and among molecular data types improves prediction of complex traits like social and intellectual ability in children born extremely preterm, suggesting that traits within the placenta-brain axis may be omnigenic.",We would like to thank the study participants of the ELGAN-ECHO study.

Prior research has been dominated by a focus on forced-choice recognition response accuracy for static face presentations of basic emotions, often involving small samples. Using free-report and multiple-choice response formats, we compared emotion recognition in IQ-matched autistic (N = 63) and nonautistic (N = 67) adult samples using 12 face emotion stimuli presented in three different stimulus formats (static, dynamic, social) that varied the degree of accompanying contextual information. Percent agreement with normative recognition responses (usually labeled ""recognition accuracy"") was slightly lower for autistic adults. Both groups displayed marked inter-individual variability and, although there was considerable overlap between groups, a very small subset of autistic individuals recorded lower percent agreement than any of the nonautistic sample. Overall, autistic individuals were significantly slower to respond and less confident. Although stimulus type, response format, and emotion affected percent agreement, latency and confidence, their interactions with group were nonsignificant and the associated effect sizes extremely small. The findings challenge notions that autistic adults have core deficits in emotion recognition and are more likely than nonautistic adults to be overwhelmed by increasingly dynamic or complex emotion stimuli and to experience difficulties recognizing specific emotions. Suggested research priorities include clarifying whether longer recognition latencies reflect fundamental processing limitations or adjustable strategic influences, probing age-related changes in emotion recognition across adulthood, and identifying the links between difficulties highlighted by traditional emotion recognition paradigms and real-world social functioning. LAY SUMMARY: It is generally considered that autistic individuals are less accurate than nonautistic individuals at recognizing other people's facial emotions. Using a wide array of emotions presented in various contexts, this study suggests that autistic individuals are, on average, only slightly less accurate but at the same time somewhat slower when classifying others' emotions. However, there was considerable overlap between the two groups, and great variability between individuals. The differences between groups prevailed regardless of how stimuli were presented, the response required or the particular emotion.","This research was supported by ARC DP 190100162 and the Hamish Ramsay Fund.

However, evidence based on parent report and on very young children is lacking. We therefore investigated the association between maternal immigrant status and early signs of neurodevelopmental problems in a population-based sample of 2-year-old children using standardized parent-report instruments. We used data from the French representative Étude Longitudinale Française depuis l'Enfance birth cohort, initiated in 2011. The study sample included 9,900 children of nonimmigrant French, 1,403 children of second, and 1,171 children of first generation immigrant women followed-up to age 2 years. Neurodevelopment was assessed using the Modified Checklist for Autism in Toddlers (M-CHAT) and an adaptation of the MacArthur-Bates Communicative Development Inventories (MB-CDI). In fully adjusted linear regression models, maternal immigrant status was associated with M-CHAT scores, with stronger associations in children of first (β-coefficient: 0.19; 95% CI 0.08-0.29) than second generation immigrants (0.09; 0.01-0.17). This association was especially strong among children of first generation immigrant mothers native of North Africa (vs. nonimmigrant French: 0.33; 0.16-0.49) and French-speaking Sub-Saharan Africa (0.26; 0.07-0.45). MB-CDI scores were lowest among children of first generation immigrant mothers, particularly from mostly non-francophone regions. Children of first generation immigrant mothers were most likely to have simultaneously low MB-CDI and high M-CHAT scores. Our findings suggest that maternal immigrant status is associated with early signs of neurodevelopmental difficulties, with strong variations according to maternal region of origin. Further research is necessary to test whether these associations persist and to determine the underlying mechanisms.

LAY SUMMARY: We asked immigrant and nonimmigrant mothers in France about early signs of neurodevelopmental problems in their 2-year-old children. Overall, we found that children of immigrants may be at higher risk of showing these early warning signs, as compared to children of nonimmigrants. This is in line with previous studies, which were based on doctors' diagnoses at later ages. However, our results differed depending on the mothers' regions of origin. We found the highest risks in children of first generation immigrants from North and French-speaking Sub-Saharan Africa, who also seemed especially at risk of neurodevelopmental problems combined with low language development.","The ELFE study is a joint project between the French Institute for Demographic Studies (INED) and the National Institute of Health and Medical Research (INSERM), in partnership with the French blood transfusion service (Etablissement Français du Sang, EFS), Santé Publique France, the National Institute for Statistics and Economic Studies (INSEE), the Direction Générale de la Santé (DGS, part of the Ministry of Health and Social Affairs), the Direction Générale de la Prévention des Risques (DGPR, Ministry for the Environment), the Direction de la Recherche, des Études, de l&#x27;Évaluation et des Statistiques (DREES, Ministry of Health and Social Affairs), the Département des Études de la Prospective et des Statistiques (DEPS, Ministry of Culture), and the Caisse Nationale des Allocations Familiales (CNAF), with the support of the Ministry of Higher Education and Research and the Institut National de la Jeunesse et de l&#x27;Éducation Populaire (INJEP).

The current study investigated the use of ME in toddlers with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and neurotypical (NT) peers matched on nonverbal cognition. Thirty-two toddlers with ASD and 26 NT toddlers participated in a looking-while-listening task. Images of novel and familiar objects were presented along with a novel or familiar label. Overall, toddlers with ASD showed less efficient looking toward a novel referent when a novel label was presented compared to NT toddlers, controlling for age and familiar word knowledge. However, toddlers with ASD and higher language ability demonstrated more robust use of ME than those with lower language ability.","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants NIDCD R01 DC012513 (Ellis Weismer, Edwards, &amp; Saffran, MPIs), NIDCD R01 DC17974 (Ellis Weismer &amp; Saffran, MPIs), and NICHD U54 HD090256 (Waisman Center core grant).

Furthermore, independent of autism diagnosis, autistic traits were not significantly associated with self-reported cyber-criminality.

Here, we examine diagnoses given in childhood among individuals that are diagnosed with autism in adulthood, to investigate whether the late autism diagnosis might be explained by misdiagnosis in childhood or diagnostic overshadowing.
MethodsThrough the Danish National Patient Registry, we identified individuals diagnosed with autism in adulthood (N = 2199), as well as a control sample with no records of an autism diagnosis (N = 460,798) and calculated how many had received different psychiatric or neurological diagnoses in childhood.ResultsWe found that most childhood diagnoses were overrepresented in those with an adult autism diagnosis, and attention-deficit hyperactivity disorder, affective disorders, anxiety, and stress disorders were the most prevalent childhood conditions in this group. However, 69% of males and 61% of females with adult autism diagnoses were not found to have received any of the investigated diagnoses before 18 years of age, and most childhood diagnoses were given after the age of 12.LimitationsMilder to moderate cases of psychiatric conditions that have been solely treated by family physicians or school psychologists may not be fully included in our dataset. The study is based on data from the Danish health care system, and further research is needed to assess whether the findings can be generalized to other countries.ConclusionA majority of those with an adult autism diagnosis had no records of having received any of the investigated diagnoses in childhood. In these cases, the late autism diagnosis is therefore unlikely to be explained by either misdiagnosis or overshadowing. This result is at odds with the prevailing notion that autistic symptoms tend to diminish with age. Therefore, further research is warranted to examine how and if early signs of autism may have manifested among these individuals, and how similar they are to autistic people diagnosed earlier in their development.",Not applicable.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Adult; Anxiety; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autistic Disorder; Comorbidity; Female; Humans; Male; Mood Disorders,13/12/2021,2021,13/12/2021,2021-12,12,1,73,All OA; Gold,Article,"Rødgaard, Eya-Mist; Jensen, Kristian; Miskowiak, Kamilla Woznica; Mottron, Laurent","Rødgaard, Eya-Mist (Department of Psychology, University of Copenhagen, 1353, Copenhagen K, Denmark); Jensen, Kristian (Department of Psychiatry and Addictology, Université de Montreal, H3T 1J4, Montreal, QC, Canada); Miskowiak, Kamilla Woznica (Department of Psychology, University of Copenhagen, 1353, Copenhagen K, Denmark; Psychiatric Centre Copenhagen, Rigshospitalet, 2100, Copenhagen Ø, Denmark); Mottron, Laurent (Department of Psychiatry and Addictology, Université de Montreal, H3T 1J4, Montreal, QC, Canada; Centre de Recherche du CIUSSS-NIM, Hôpital Rivière-des-Prairies, H1E 1A4, Montreal, QC, Canada)","Mottron, Laurent (University of Montreal; Hôpital Rivière-des-Prairies)","Rødgaard, Eya-Mist (University of Copenhagen); Jensen, Kristian (University of Montreal); Miskowiak, Kamilla Woznica (University of Copenhagen; Rigshospitalet); Mottron, Laurent (University of Montreal; Hôpital Rivière-des-Prairies)",Hôpital Rivière-des-Prairies; Rigshospitalet; University of Copenhagen; University of Montreal,grid.414305.7; grid.475435.4; grid.5254.6; grid.14848.31,Canada; Denmark; Denmark; Canada,Lundbeck Foundation; Brain Canada Foundation,3,3,,,24,https://molecularautism.biomedcentral.com/counter/pdf/10.1186/s13229-021-00478-y,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143840762,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,,No,,,

While a number of studies have described specific environmental factors associating with emerging ASD, studies that compare and contrast multiple environmental factors in the same study are lacking. Thus, the goal of this study was to perform a prospective, data-driven environmental-wide association study of pre- and perinatal factors associated with the later development of autistic symptoms in childhood. The participants included 3891 6-year-old children from a birth cohort with pre- and perinatal data. Autistic symptoms were measured using the Social Responsiveness Scale in all children. Prior to any analyses, the sample was randomly split into a discovery set (2920) and a test set (921). Multiple linear regression analyses were performed for each of 920 variables, correcting for six of the most common covariates in epidemiological studies. We found 111 different pre- and perinatal factors associated with autistic traits during childhood. In secondary analyses where we controlled for parental psychopathology, 23 variables in the domains of family and interpersonal relationships were associated with the development of autistic symptoms during childhood. In conclusion, a data-driven approach was used to identify a number of pre- and perinatal risk factors associating with higher childhood autistic symptoms. These factors include measures of parental psychopathology and family and interpersonal relationships. These measures could potentially be used for the early identification of those at increased risk to develop ASD. LAY SUMMARY: A combination of genetic and environmental factors contributes to the development of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Each environmental factor may affect the risk of ASD. In a study on 6-year-old children, a number of pre- and perinatal risk factors were identified that are associated with autistic symptoms in childhood. These factors include measures of parental psychopathology and family and interpersonal relationships. These variables could potentially serve as markers to identify those at increased risk to develop ASD or autistic symptoms.

A toothbrushing visual pedagogy (TBVP) was developed adapting existing toothbrushing social stories for children with ASD. This TBVP consists of 13 toothbrushing steps with scripts describing the toothbrushing technique. To evaluate its feasibility, a review panel was formed to provide feedback on the TBVP and three other published toothbrushing social stories. Effectiveness of the TBVP was further evaluated among 119 preschool children with ASD with significant improvements in toothbrushing skills observed at 3-month and 6-month follow-ups. It is concluded that TBVP is a feasible and an effective educational means that assists children with ASD in learning toothbrushing skills.","We would like to give many thanks to the children and parents who participated in this study.

However, the prevalence data for southern Europe seem to be lower than international reports and notable methodological differences have been reported among studies. The objective of the Neurodevelopmental Disorders Epidemiological Research Project was to estimate the prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in a representative school sample of the province of Tarragona, Spain. The study included a screening procedure through parents (N = 3727) and teachers (N = 6894), and an individual assessment of children at risk and a comparison group (N = 781). The overall estimated prevalence in our sample was 1.53%, being significantly higher than the 0.83% previously registered diagnoses. A total of 3.31% of the children presented subclinical characteristics of autism spectrum disorder. Girls showed a significantly lower estimated prevalence in all the conditions. Severity profiles were distributed as 46% mild, 47% moderate and 7% severe. Psychological support (65%), educational support (65%) and language therapy (51%) were given to children with autism spectrum disorder. Pharmacological treatment was only found among school-aged children (37.5%). Public schools provided more educational supports (72%) than private schools (36%). The heterogeneity of autism spectrum disorder makes it difficult to determine specific associated sociodemographic factors. The results confirmed a high prevalence of autism spectrum disorder in the province, suggesting a current under-diagnosis in public health services. In view of the results, it is important to promote early diagnosis and intervention, especially in particular groups such as girls, children with intellectual disabilities and children from immigrant families.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Female; Humans; Parents; Population Surveillance; Prevalence; Schools,22/04/2021,2021,22/04/2021,2021-10,25,7,1999-2011,Closed,Article,"Hidalgo, Paula Morales; Moreso, Núria Voltas; Sans, Josefa Canals","Hidalgo, Paula Morales (Research Group on Nutrition and Mental Health (NUTRISAM), Research Center for Behavioral Assessment (CRAMC), Department of Psychology, University Rovira i Virgili, Spain); Moreso, Núria Voltas (Research Group on Nutrition and Mental Health (NUTRISAM), Research Center for Behavioral Assessment (CRAMC), Department of Psychology, University Rovira i Virgili, Spain; Serra Húnter Fellow, University Rovira i Virgili, Spain); Sans, Josefa Canals (Research Group on Nutrition and Mental Health (NUTRISAM), Research Center for Behavioral Assessment (CRAMC), Department of Psychology, University Rovira i Virgili, Spain)","Sans, Josefa Canals (Rovira i Virgili University)","Hidalgo, Paula Morales (Rovira i Virgili University); Moreso, Núria Voltas (Rovira i Virgili University; Rovira i Virgili University); Sans, Josefa Canals (Rovira i Virgili University)",Rovira i Virgili University,grid.410367.7,Spain,European Commission,8,8,,,4,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1137354205,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,4 Quality Education,No,,,

The demands of caregiving can have negative effects on the mental and physical wellbeing of parents. Different types of formal support have been developed to help parents to cope with caregiving; however, many parents struggle to access services due to limited availability and busy schedules. The Internet could offer parents more accessible and flexible support. We asked 17 parents what content they would like to include in an online resource. Parents told us about their experiences trying to access and use existing formal support and websites. They overwhelmingly supported the development of an online resource informed by their suggestions. Parents emphasised the need for easier access to information through educational components and direct access to healthcare professionals online. Parents also wanted help with finding existing services and reliable, locally relevant information. Parents stressed the need for a safe environment to meet and chat with other parents online. This research forms the first stage in the development process of an online health resource for parents.",The authors thank Dr Fang Liu and Mirjana Jeremic for their work recruiting participants and facilitating the focus groups.

Prevalence ratios were also stratified by race.

This is the first study, to our knowledge, that investigates ASD prevalence of children from non-English-speaking households in a large sample.

This pilot study examined 10 male participants with ASD who were administered OT intranasally for 8-10 weeks in an open-label, single-arm, nonrandomized, and uncontrolled manner. Positron emission tomography (PET) with a radiotracer (11 C)-3-amino-4-(2-[(dimethylamino)methyl]phenylthio)benzonitrile (11 C-DASB) was used before and after OT treatment. The binding potential of serotonin transporter (11 C-DASB BPND ) was then estimated. The main outcome measures were changes in 11 C-DASB BPND and their correlation with changes in symptoms. ASD participants showed significantly elevated 11 C-DASB BPND in the left inferior frontal gyrus extending to the left middle frontal gyrus. No significant correlation was found between the change in any clinical symptom and the change in 11 C-DASB BPND . This report of a pilot study is the first describing long-term effects of OT on the brain's serotonin system in ASD. Additional randomized controlled studies must be conducted to confirm whether activation of the serotonergic system contributes to the prosocial effect of OT in people with ASD.

Although questionnaires such as the 20-item Toronto Alexithymia Scale (TAS-20) are frequently used to measure alexithymia in the autistic population, few studies have investigated the psychometric properties of these questionnaires in autistic adults, including whether differential item functioning (I-DIF) exists between autistic and general population adults.MethodsThis study is a revised version of a previous article that was retracted due to copyright concerns (Williams and Gotham in Mol Autism 12:1–40). We conducted an in-depth psychometric analysis of the TAS-20 in a large sample of 743 cognitively able autistic adults recruited from the Simons Foundation SPARK participant pool and 721 general population controls enrolled in a large international psychological study. The factor structure of the TAS-20 was examined using confirmatory factor analysis, and item response theory was used to generate a subset of the items that were strong indicators of a “general alexithymia” factor. Correlations between alexithymia and other clinical outcomes were used to assess the nomological validity of the new alexithymia score in the SPARK sample.ResultsThe TAS-20 did not exhibit adequate model fit in either the autistic or general population samples. Empirically driven item reduction was undertaken, resulting in an 8-item general alexithymia factor score (GAFS-8, with “TAS” no longer referenced due to copyright) with sound psychometric properties and practically ignorable I-DIF between diagnostic groups. Correlational analyses indicated that GAFS-8 scores, as derived from the TAS-20, meaningfully predict autistic trait levels, repetitive behaviors, and depression symptoms, even after controlling for trait neuroticism. The GAFS-8 also presented no meaningful decrement in nomological validity over the full TAS-20 in autistic participants.LimitationsLimitations of the current study include a sample of autistic adults that was majority female, later diagnosed, and well educated; clinical and control groups drawn from different studies with variable measures; only 16 of the TAS-20 items being administered to the non-autistic sample; and an inability to test several other important psychometric characteristics of the GAFS-8, including sensitivity to change and I-DIF across multiple administrations.ConclusionsThese results indicate the potential of the GAFS-8 to robustly measure alexithymia in both autistic and non-autistic adults.

Differences in behavioral and neural responses to affective touch may have an important developmental role in early social experiences, which are relevant for autism spectrum disorder (ASD).MethodsUsing probabilistic tractography, we compared the structural integrity of white matter pathways for discriminative and affective touch in young children with ASD and their typically developing (TD) peers. We examined two tracts: (1) a tract linking the thalamus with the primary somatosensory cortex, which carries discriminative tactile information, and (2) a tract linking the posterior insula—the cortical projection target of unmyelinated tactile afferents mediating affective touch—with the anterior insula, which integrates sensory and visceral inputs to interpret emotional salience of sensory stimuli. We investigated associations between tract integrity and performance on a standardized observational assessment measuring tactile discrimination and affective responses to touch.ResultsBoth the thalamocortical and intrainsular tracts showed reduced integrity (higher mean diffusivity) in the ASD group compared to those in the TD group. Consistent with the previous findings, the ASD group exhibited impaired tactile discriminative ability, more tactile defensiveness, and more sensory seeking (e.g., enthusiastic play or repetitive engagement with a specific tactile stimulus). There was a significant relation between intrainsular tract integrity and tactile seeking. The direction of this relation differed between groups: higher intrainsular mean diffusivity (MD) (reflecting decreased tract integrity) was associated with increased tactile seeking in the TD group but with decreased tactile seeking in the ASD group. In the TD group, decreased tactile defensiveness was also associated with higher intrainsular MD, but there was no relation in the ASD group. Discriminative touch was not significantly associated with integrity of either tract in either group.ConclusionsThese results support previous findings suggesting a central role for the insula in affective response to touch. While both discriminative and affective touch and both somatosensory tracts are affected in ASD, the restriction of brain–behavior associations to the intrainsular tract and tactile seeking suggests more complex and perhaps higher-order influence on differences in tactile defensiveness and discrimination.",The authors thank Dr. Norman Farb for providing the intrainsular ROI tracing protocol and Dr. Grace Baranek for providing the laboratory for training and guidance in the use of the TDDT-R.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Affect; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain Mapping; Case-Control Studies; Child; Child, Preschool; Diffusion Tensor Imaging; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Somatosensory Cortex; Thalamus; Touch; Touch Perception; White Matter",13/06/2017,2017,13/06/2017,2017-12,8,1,25,All OA; Gold,Article,"Failla, Michelle D.; Peters, Brittany R.; Karbasforoushan, Haleh; Foss-Feig, Jennifer H.; Schauder, Kimberly B.; Heflin, Brynna H.; Cascio, Carissa J.","Failla, Michelle D.

However, validation studies on this mode of case ascertainment have lacked access to high-quality clinical diagnostic data and have not followed published reporting guidelines. We report on the diagnostic accuracy of using readily available health administrative data for pediatric ASD case ascertainment. The validation cohort included almost all the ASD-positive children born in British Columbia, Canada from April 1, 2000 to December 31, 2009 and consisted of 8,670 children in total. 4,079 ASD-positive and 2,787 ASD-negative children were identified using Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) and Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised (ADI-R) assessments done through the British Columbia Autism Assessment Network (BCAAN). An additional 1,804 ADOS/ADI-R assessed ASD-positive children were identified using Ministry of Education records. This prospectively collected clinical data (the diagnostic gold standard) was then linked to each child's physician billing and hospital discharge data. The diagnostic accuracy of 11 algorithms that used the administrative data to assign ASD case status was assessed. For all algorithms, high positive predictive values (PPVs) were observed alongside low values for other measures of diagnostic accuracy illustrating that PPVs alone are not an adequate measure of diagnostic accuracy. We show that British Columbia's health administrative data cannot reliably be used to discriminate between children with ASD and children with other developmental disorders. Utilizing these data may result in misclassification bias. Methodologically sound, region-specific validation studies are needed to support the use of administrative data for ASD case ascertainment.

The current study evaluated neural activation in participants with ASD and neurotypical (NT) controls during a speech production task.
Methods: Neural activities of participants with ASD (N = 15, M = 16.7 years, language abilities ranged from low verbal abilities to verbally fluent) and NT controls (N = 12, M = 17.1 years) was examined using functional magnetic resonance imaging with a sparse-sampling paradigm.
Results: There were no differences between the ASD and NT groups in average speech activation or inter-subject run-to-run variability in speech activation. Intra-subject run-to-run neural variability was greater in the ASD group and was positively correlated with autism severity in cortical areas associated with speech.
Conclusions: These findings highlight the importance of understanding intra-subject neural variability in participants with ASD.","This work was supported by the National Institute of Health (P50 DC013027, H.

To address this question, we used magnetoencephalography to compare the cortical responses between ASD and typically developing (TD) individuals to a passive mismatch paradigm. We repeated the paradigm twice, once in a quiet background, and once in the presence of background noise. We focused on both the evoked mismatch field (MMF) response in temporal and frontal cortical locations, and functional connectivity with spectral specificity between those locations. In the quiet condition, we found common neural sources of the MMF response in both groups, in the right temporal gyrus and inferior frontal gyrus (IFG). In the noise condition, the MMF response in the right IFG was preserved in the TD group, but reduced relative to the quiet condition in ASD group. The MMF response in the right IFG also correlated with severity of ASD. Moreover, in noise, we found significantly reduced normalized coherence (deviant normalized by standard) in ASD relative to TD, in the beta band (14-25 Hz), between left temporal and left inferior frontal sub-regions. However, unnormalized coherence (coherence during deviant or standard) was significantly increased in ASD relative to TD, in multiple frequency bands. Our findings suggest increased recruitment of neural resources in ASD irrespective of the task difficulty, alongside a reduction in top-down modulations, usually mediated by the beta band, needed to mitigate the impact of noise on auditory processing.

It has been hypothesized that exposure to elevated levels of prenatal testosterone is associated with elevated traits of ASD and ADHD. Assuming that testosterone levels from a dizygotic male twin fetus may lead to enhanced testosterone exposure of its co-twins, we aimed to test the prenatal testosterone hypothesis by comparing same-sex with opposite-sex dizygotic twins with respect to neurodevelopmental symptoms.MethodsNeuropsychiatric traits were assessed in a population-based twin cohort from the Child and Adolescent Twin Study in Sweden (CATSS). Parental interviews were conducted for 16,312 dizygotic twins, 9 and 12 years old, with the Autism—Tics, ADHD, and other Comorbidities inventory (A-TAC).ResultsGirls with a female co-twin had an increased risk of reaching the cut-off score for ADHD compared with girls with a male co-twin. Both boys and girls with a female co-twin displayed a larger number of traits related to attention deficit and repetitive and stereotyped behaviors than those with a male twin. In girls, this also extended to social interaction and the combined measures for ASD and ADHD, however, with small effect sizes.ConclusionsOur results are reverse to what would have been expected from the prenatal testosterone hypothesis but consistent with a previous study of ASD and ADHD traits in dizygotic twins. The seemingly protective effect for girls of having a twin brother may be an effect of parent report bias, but may also be an unexpected effect of sharing the intrauterine environment with a male co-twin.","This project was supported by the Swedish Research Council (Grant No 523-2011-3646), The Brain Foundation, Bertil Hållsten’s Foundation, and Söderström’s foundation.

However, the neuroanatomical differences between male and female children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are an intriguing and still poorly investigated issue. This study aims to evaluate whether the brain of young children with ASD exhibits sex-related structural differences and if a correlation exists between clinical ASD features and neuroanatomical underpinnings.MethodsA total of 152 structural MRI scans were analysed. Specifically, 76 young children with ASD (38 males and 38 females; 2–7 years of age; mean = 53 months, standard deviation = 17 months) were evaluated employing a support vector machine (SVM)-based analysis of the grey matter (GM). Group comparisons consisted of 76 age-, gender- and non-verbal-intelligence quotient-matched children with typical development or idiopathic developmental delay without autism.ResultsFor both genders combined, SVM showed a significantly increased GM volume in young children with ASD with respect to control subjects, predominantly in the bilateral superior frontal gyrus (Brodmann area –BA– 10), bilateral precuneus (BA 31), bilateral superior temporal gyrus (BA 20/22), whereas less GM in patients with ASD was found in right inferior temporal gyrus (BA 37). For the within gender comparisons (i.e., females with ASD vs. controls and males with ASD vs. controls), two overlapping regions in bilateral precuneus (BA 31) and left superior frontal gyrus (BA 9/10) were detected. Sex-by-group analyses revealed in males with ASD compared to matched controls two male-specific regions of increased GM volume (left middle occipital gyrus—BA 19—and right superior temporal gyrus—BA 22). Comparisons in females with and without ASD demonstrated increased GM volumes predominantly in the bilateral frontal regions. Additional regions of significantly increased GM volume in the right anterior cingulate cortex (BA 32) and right cerebellum were typical only of females with ASD.ConclusionsDespite the specific behavioural correlates of sex-dimorphism in ASD, brain morphology as yet remains unclear and requires future dedicated investigations. This study provides evidence of structural brain gender differences in young children with ASD that possibly contribute to the different phenotypic disease manifestations in males and females.",We are grateful to all children and their parents for taking part in this study.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Area Under Curve; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Cerebrospinal Fluid; Child; Child, Preschool; Female; Gray Matter; Humans; Infant; Intelligence; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neuroimaging; Organ Size; Phenotype; Research Design; Severity of Illness Index; Sex Characteristics; Support Vector Machine; White Matter",19/01/2016,2016,19/01/2016,2016-12,7,1,5,All OA; Gold,Article,"Retico, Alessandra; Giuliano, Alessia; Tancredi, Raffaella; Cosenza, Angela; Apicella, Fabio; Narzisi, Antonio; Biagi, Laura; Tosetti, Michela; Muratori, Filippo; Calderoni, Sara","Retico, Alessandra (Istituto Nazionale di Fisica Nucleare, Pisa Division, Largo B.

The aim of this study is to examine the effects of mindfulness training for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, combined with Mindful Parenting training.
METHOD: A total of 23 adolescents with autism spectrum disorder, referred to a mental health clinic, received nine weekly sessions of mindfulness training in group format. Their parents (18 mothers, 11 fathers) participated in parallel Mindful Parenting training. A pre-test, post-test, and 9-week follow-up design was used. Data were analyzed using multi-level analyses.
RESULTS: Attendance rate was 88% for adolescents and fathers and 86% for mothers. Adolescents reported an increase in quality of life and a decrease in rumination, but no changes in worry, autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, or mindful awareness. Although parents reported no change in adolescent's autism spectrum disorder core symptoms, they reported improved social responsiveness, social communication, social cognition, preoccupations, and social motivation. About themselves, parents reported improvement in general as well as in parental mindfulness. They reported improved competence in parenting, overall parenting styles, more specifically a less lax, verbose parenting style, and an increased quality of life.
DISCUSSION: Mindfulness training for adolescents with autism spectrum disorder combined with Mindful Parenting is feasible. Although the sample size was small and no control group was included, the first outcomes of this innovative training are positive.",We would like to thank Nynke Wagenaar and Anne Formsma for their valuable assistance in the data collection.,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mindfulness; Parent-Child Relations; Parenting; Parents; Quality of Life; Young Adult,27/10/2014,2014,27/10/2014,2015-11,19,8,906-914,Closed,Article,"de Bruin, Esther I; Blom, René; Smit, Franka MA; van Steensel, Francisca JA; Bögels, Susan M","de Bruin, Esther I (Research Institute of Child Development and Education (RICDE), University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Research Priority Area Yield, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Blom, René (Karakter, Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, The Netherlands); Smit, Franka MA (Research Institute of Child Development and Education (RICDE), University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Research Priority Area Yield, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands); van Steensel, Francisca JA (Research Institute of Child Development and Education (RICDE), University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Research Priority Area Yield, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; UvA minds, academic outpatient child and adolescent treatment center of the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands); Bögels, Susan M (Research Institute of Child Development and Education (RICDE), University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; Research Priority Area Yield, University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands; UvA minds, academic outpatient child and adolescent treatment center of the University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)","de Bruin, Esther I (University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam)","de Bruin, Esther I (University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam); Blom, René (Karakter); Smit, Franka MA (University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam); van Steensel, Francisca JA (University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam); Bögels, Susan M (University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam; University of Amsterdam)",Karakter; University of Amsterdam,grid.461871.d; grid.7177.6,Netherlands; Netherlands,,96,37,3.2,17.22,72,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1027079181,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,No,,,

It uses an algorithm to assess 12 body regions and categorizes Autism on the number of dysmorphic regions identified; Essential (≤ 3), Equivocal (4–5) or Complex (≥ 6). We evaluated 200 Indian children with Autism (mean age 3.7 years) in a hospital-based cross-sectional study and compared inter-group profiles. We found 31% Essential, 49% Equivocal and 20% Complex Autism. On comparing results with existing literature, it appeared that genetic ancestry and age significantly influenced dysmorphism and hence categorization. No significant differences were observed between complex and essential autism in epilepsy, severity of autism or development, as reported earlier. These shortcomings make the present tool unsuitable for use in young Indian children with Autism.","The paper is based on the M.D. thesis of Dr Neelam that was conceptualized, designed and supervised by Dr S.

In the control group, we observed changes in the eye-movement patterns between the first and the last presentation of the degraded stimulus, reflecting top-down optimization of eye-movement patterns, that is, a decrease in the number of fixations and interfixation distance, coupled with an increase in the duration of fixations. This effect was attenuated in individuals with autism, pointing to a decreased rate of perceptual learning. We also found that participants with autism displayed decreased scanpath stability, that is, a lower recurrence of fixation locations between different presentations of the same image, which may suggests a lower rate of perceptual learning or decreased predictability in the eye-movement patterns. These results provide evidence for decreased use of prior knowledge in perceptual decisions in autism.

LAY SUMMARY: We showed autistic and typically developing participants some degraded images that were difficult to recognize for the first time, but once you knew what they represent, you could see it easily. We found that the eye-movement patterns of persons with autism did not change as much after learning what the pictures represented as in the case of typically developing participants.

In this population nested case-control study, based on the Israeli National Insurance Institute records, we aimed to estimate the associations in the Israeli population. The study population included all children born between 2000 and 2012 and diagnosed with ASD (N = 12,635 cases), and a random 20% sample of children born in the same period who were not diagnosed with ASD (N = 369,548 controls). We used multiple logistic regression models to calculate the risk of ASD for each BW and GA category, adjusted for covariates (child sex, maternal age, paternal age, population group, maternal wage, paternal wage, having a sibling with ASD, multiple gestation and socioeconomic status). BW < 3,000 g and GA < 39 weeks were associated with higher risk of ASD, including BW of 2,500-3,000 g (adjusted odds ratio [AOR], 1.18; 95% CI, 1.12-1.24, in comparison to the 3,000-3,500 g category) and GA of 37 & 38 weeks (AOR, 1.35; 95% CI, 1.25-1.45 and AOR, 1.13; 95% CI 1.06-1.20, respectively; in comparison to GA of 40 weeks). To account for the high correlation between GA and BW, we modeled BW percentiles for gestational age and found that the BW < 20th percentile was associated with an increased risk of ASD (AOR, 1.10; 95% CI, 1.01-1.19). These results demonstrate that associations of ASD with BW and GA are not limited to commonly used clinical cutoffs.

There are no epidemiological data on autism for Mexico. This study was conducted to generate a first estimate of ASD prevalence in Mexico. We surveyed children age eight in Leon (Guanajuato). The sample was stratified in two strata: (1) children having special education and medical records (SEMR; N = 432) and (2) children attending regular schools (GSS; N = 11,684). GSS children were screened with the SRS and those with the highest scores were invited to a diagnostic evaluation. The final sample comprised 36 children (80.6 % male) who had confirmed ASD. A third had intellectual disability, 25 % were non-verbal, 69 % had co-occurring behavioral problems. The prevalence overall was 0.87 % (95 % CI 0.62, 1.1 %).

Our previous copy number variation (CNV) study discovered a novel deleted region associated with ASD. One of the genes included in the deleted region is ARHGEF10. A missense mutation of ARHGEF10 has been reported to be one of the contributing factors in several diseases of the central nervous system. However, the relationship between the loss of ARHGEF10 and the clinical symptoms of ASD is unclear.MethodsWe generated Arhgef10 knockout mice as a model of ASD and characterized the social behavior and the biochemical changes in the brains of the knockout mice.ResultsCompared with their wild-type littermates, the Arhgef10-depleted mice showed social interaction impairment, hyperactivity, and decreased depression-like and anxiety-like behavior. Behavioral measures of learning in the Morris water maze were not affected by Arhgef10 deficiency. Moreover, neurotransmitters including serotonin, norepinephrine, and dopamine were significantly increased in different brain regions of the Arhgef10 knockout mice. In addition, monoamine oxidase A (MAO-A) decreased in several brain regions.ConclusionsThese results suggest that ARHGEF10 is a candidate risk gene for ASD and that the Arhgef10 knockout model could be a tool for studying the mechanisms of neurotransmission in ASD.Trial registrationAnimal studies were approved by the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee of National Taiwan University (IACUC 20150023).

About half of these parents reported to having good QoL. The factors identified in the double ABCX model showed that perceived social support and sense of coherence (SOC) were mediated by coping strategies and had a positive direct and indirect effect on parents’ QoL.

This study examines emotional disclosure through the activity of journaling as a means of coping with maternal stress associated with parenting a child with disruptive behaviors. Through a randomized control and pre-test post-test study design of an online journal writing intervention, change to maternal stress and quality of mother–child relationship for children with ASD, ADHD and SPD was addressed. Behavioral symptoms were found to be the primary source of parenting stress for mothers and a significant relationship between child characteristics and maternal stress was identified. Emotional disclosure through the online journal writing program (especially in the presence of high disclosure of negative emotions) was shown to reduce maternal stress and improve the quality of mother–child relationship. These findings suggest cost-effective telehealth interventions may support maternal health. Important clinical implications are discussed.",This research was funded in part from support from the California Occupational Therapy Foundation.,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Adolescent; Adult; Child; Child, Preschool; Disclosure; Emotions; Female; Humans; Male; Middle Aged; Mother-Child Relations; Mothers; Problem Behavior; Stress, Psychological; Telemedicine; Writing",13/12/2014,2014,13/12/2014,2015-11,45,11,3735-3745,Closed,Article,"Whitney, Rondalyn V.; Smith, Gigi","Whitney, Rondalyn V.

The target cues used in previous studies were often straightforward and might not reflect real-life learning of such associations which requires learners to infer which cue(s) among many to track. Across two experiments, we compared adult learners with varying levels of autistic traits on their ability to infer the correct cue to learn probabilistic cue-outcome associations when explicitly instructed to do so or when exposed implicitly. We found no evidence for the effect of autistic traits on probabilistic learning accuracy, contrary to the predictions of Bayesian/predictive coding models. Implications for the current Bayesian/predictive coding models are discussed.","We are grateful to all our participants who volunteered their time to participate in research despite the ongoing pandemic.

A Factor-Analytic and Network Approach,"Despite the heterogeneity in autism, socioemotional difficulties are often framed as universal. Increasing evidence, however, suggests that socioemotional difficulties may be explained by alexithymia, a distinct yet frequently co-occurring condition. If, as some propose, autistic traits are responsible for socioemotional impairments, then alexithymia may itself be a symptom of autism. We aimed to determine whether alexithymia should be considered a product of autism or regarded as a separate condition. Using factor-analytic and network approaches, we provide evidence that alexithymic and autistic traits are distinct. We argue that: (1) models of socioemotional processing in autism should conceptualise difficulties as intrinsic to alexithymia; and (2) assessment of alexithymia is crucial for diagnosis and personalised interventions.","The authors would like to thank all the volunteers that took part in this study, RAs and Mirta Stantic for their help with data collection.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Affective Symptoms; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Humans; Phenotype,01/06/2021,2021,01/06/2021,2022-05,52,5,2019-2034,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Cuve, Hélio Clemente; Murphy, Jennifer; Hobson, Hannah; Ichijo, Eri; Catmur, Caroline; Bird, Geoffrey","Cuve, Hélio Clemente (Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Anna Watts Building, Radcliffe Observatory, Woodstock Rd, OX2 6GG, Oxford, UK); Murphy, Jennifer (Department of Psychology, Royal Holloway, University of London, London, UK); Hobson, Hannah (Department of Psychology, University of York, York, UK); Ichijo, Eri (Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Anna Watts Building, Radcliffe Observatory, Woodstock Rd, OX2 6GG, Oxford, UK); Catmur, Caroline (Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London, London, UK); Bird, Geoffrey (Department of Experimental Psychology, University of Oxford, Anna Watts Building, Radcliffe Observatory, Woodstock Rd, OX2 6GG, Oxford, UK; Social, Genetic and Developmental Psychiatry Centre, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London, London, UK)","Cuve, Hélio Clemente (University of Oxford)","Cuve, Hélio Clemente (University of Oxford); Murphy, Jennifer (Royal Holloway University of London); Hobson, Hannah (University of York); Ichijo, Eri (University of Oxford); Catmur, Caroline (King's College London); Bird, Geoffrey (University of Oxford; King's College London)",University of York; Royal Holloway University of London; King's College London; University of Oxford,grid.5685.e; grid.4970.a; grid.13097.3c; grid.4991.5,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Economic and Social Research Council; University of Oxford,7,7,,,3,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10803-021-05094-6.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138507052,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,,No,,,

Previous clinical trials of oral SF demonstrated positive clinical effects on behavior in young men and changes in urinary metabolomics in children with ASD.
MethodsWe conducted a 15-week randomized parallel double-blind placebo-controlled clinical trial with 15-week open-label treatment and 6-week no-treatment extensions in 57 children, ages 3–12 years, with ASD over 36 weeks. Twenty-eight were assigned SF and 29 received placebo (PL). Clinical effects, safety and tolerability of SF were measured as were biomarkers to elucidate mechanisms of action of SF in ASD.ResultsData from 22 children taking SF and 23 on PL were analyzed. Treatment effects on the primary outcome measure, the Ohio Autism Clinical Impressions Scale (OACIS), in the general level of autism were not significant between SF and PL groups at 7 and 15 weeks. The effect sizes on the OACIS were non-statistically significant but positive, suggesting a possible trend toward greater improvement in those on treatment with SF (Cohen’s d 0.21; 95% CI − 0.46, 0.88 and 0.10; 95% CI − 0.52, 0.72, respectively). Both groups improved in all subscales when on SF during the open-label phase. Caregiver ratings on secondary outcome measures improved significantly on the Aberrant Behavior Checklist (ABC) at 15 weeks (Cohen’s d − 0.96; 95% CI − 1.73, − 0.15), but not on the Social Responsiveness Scale-2 (SRS-2). Ratings on the ABC and SRS-2 improved with a non-randomized analysis of the length of exposure to SF, compared to the pre-treatment baseline (p < 0.001). There were significant changes with SF compared to PL in biomarkers of glutathione redox status, mitochondrial respiration, inflammatory markers and heat shock proteins. Clinical laboratory studies confirmed product safety. SF was very well tolerated and side effects of treatment, none serious, included rare insomnia, irritability and intolerance of the taste and smell.LimitationsThe sample size was limited to 45 children with ASD and we did not impute missing data. We were unable to document significant changes in clinical assessments during clinical visits in those taking SF compared to PL. The clinical results were confounded by placebo effects during the open-label phase.ConclusionsSF led to small yet non-statistically significant changes in the total and all subscale scores of the primary outcome measure, while for secondary outcome measures, caregivers’ assessments of children taking SF showed statistically significant improvements compared to those taking PL on the ABC but not the SRS-2. Clinical effects of SF were less notable in children compared to our previous trial of a SF-rich preparation in young men with ASD. Several of the effects of SF on biomarkers correlated to clinical improvements. SF was very well tolerated and safe and effective based on our secondary clinical measures.Trial registration: This study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02561481) on September 28, 2015.

However, findings may lack generalizability because: (a) most have focused solely on the ASD male brain phenotype, and not sex-differences in WM integrity; (b) many lack stringent and transparent data quality control such as controlling for head motion in analysis. This study addressed both issues by using Tract-Based Spatial Statistics (TBSS) to separately compare WM differences in 81 ASD (56 male, 25 female; 4-21 years old) and 39 typically developing (TD; 23 males, 16 females; 5-18 years old) children and young people, carefully group-matched on sex, age, cognitive abilities, and head motion. ASD males and females were also matched on autism symptom severity. Two independent-raters completed a multistep scan quality assurance to remove images that were significantly distorted by motion artifacts before analysis. ASD females exhibited significant widespread reductions in FA compared to TD females, suggesting altered WM integrity. In contrast, no significant localized or widespread WM differences were found between ASD and TD males. This study highlights the importance of data quality control in DTI, and outlines important sex-differences in WM alterations in ASD females. Future studies can explore the extent to which neural structural differences might underlie sex-differences in ASD behavioral phenotype, and guide clinical interventions to be tailored toward the unique needs of ASD females and males.

LAY SUMMARY: Previous Diffusion Tensor Imaging (DTI) studies have found atypical brain structural connectivity in males with autism, although findings are inconclusive in females with autism. To investigate potential sex-differences, we studied males and females with and without autism who showed a similar level of head movement during their brain scan. We found that females with autism had widespread atypical neural connectivity than females without autism, although not in males, highlighting sex-differences.","We would like to thank all the children and their families who have taken part in this research, without them, none of this would have been possible.

There is little mention of autistic burnout in the academic literature. Only one recent study has used interviews and reviews of social media descriptions to try to understand autistic burnout. Anecdotally, autistic burnout is a very debilitating condition that reduced people's daily living skills and can lead to suicide attempts. It is suggested that autistic burnout is caused by the stress of masking and living in an unaccommodating neurotypical world. We wanted to create a definition of autistic burnout that could be used by clinicians and the autism community. We used the Grounded Delphi method, which allowed autistic voice to lead the study. Autistic adults who had experienced autistic burnout were considered as experts on the topic, in the co-production of this definition. The definition describes autistic burnout as a condition involving exhaustion, withdrawal, problems with thinking, reduced daily living skills and increases in the manifestation of autistic traits. It is important for future research that there is a specific description of the condition. In practice, it is important for clinicians to be aware that autistic burnout is different from depression. Psychological treatments for depression potentially could make autistic burnout worse. Further awareness of autistic burnout is needed, as well as further research to prove this condition is separate from depression, chronic fatigue and non-autistic burnout.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Burnout, Psychological; Humans",04/06/2021,2021,04/06/2021,2021-11,25,8,2356-2369,Closed,Article,"Higgins, Julianne M; Arnold, Samuel RC; Weise, Janelle; Pellicano, Elizabeth; Trollor, Julian N","Higgins, Julianne M (Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, School of Psychiatry, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), Long Pocket, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia); Arnold, Samuel RC (Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, School of Psychiatry, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), Long Pocket, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia); Weise, Janelle (Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, School of Psychiatry, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia); Pellicano, Elizabeth (Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), Long Pocket, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; Macquarie School of Education, Macquarie University, 29 Wally’s Walk, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia); Trollor, Julian N (Department of Developmental Disability Neuropsychiatry, School of Psychiatry, UNSW, Sydney, New South Wales, Australia; Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), Long Pocket, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia)","Arnold, Samuel RC (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC)","Higgins, Julianne M (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC); Arnold, Samuel RC (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC); Weise, Janelle (UNSW Sydney); Pellicano, Elizabeth (Autism CRC; Macquarie University); Trollor, Julian N (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC)",Macquarie University; Autism CRC; UNSW Sydney,grid.1004.5; grid.478764.e; grid.1005.4,Australia; Australia; Australia,"Department of Industry, Science, Energy and Resources",20,20,,,93,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138635814,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,,No,,,

Despite the early emergence of sensory features (< age 3) and their potential impact on development and quality of life, little is known about the neural mechanisms underlying sensory reactivity in early childhood autism.MethodsHere, we used electroencephalography (EEG) to investigate tactile cortical processing in young children aged 3–6 years with autism and in neurotypical (NT) children. Scalp EEG was recorded from 33 children with autism, including those with low cognitive and/or verbal abilities, and 45 age- and sex-matched NT children during passive tactile fingertip stimulation. We compared properties of early and later somatosensory-evoked potentials (SEPs) and their adaptation with repetitive stimulation between autistic and NT children and assessed whether these neural measures are linked to “real-world” parent-reported tactile reactivity.ResultsAs expected, we found elevated tactile reactivity in children on the autism spectrum. Our findings indicated no differences in amplitude or latency of early and mid-latency somatosensory-evoked potentials (P50, N80, P100), nor adaptation between autistic and NT children. However, latency of later processing of tactile information (N140) was shorter in young children with autism compared to NT children, suggesting faster processing speed in young autistic children. Further, correlational analyses and exploratory analyses using tactile reactivity as a grouping variable found that enhanced early neural responses were associated with greater tactile reactivity in autism.LimitationsThe relatively small sample size and the inclusion of a broad range of autistic children (e.g., with low cognitive and/or verbal abilities) may have limited our power to detect subtle group differences and associations. Hence, replications are needed to verify these results.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that electrophysiological somatosensory cortex processing measures may be indices of “real-world” tactile reactivity in early childhood autism. Together, these findings advance our understanding of the neurophysiological mechanisms underlying tactile reactivity in early childhood autism and, in the clinical context, may have therapeutic implications.","We thank all participants who took part in this study and, in particular, our autistic participants and their parents/guardians who, with their interest and dedication, make autism research possible.",Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Autistic Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Electroencephalography; Evoked Potentials, Somatosensory; Female; Humans; Male; Somatosensory Cortex; Touch",01/04/2021,2021,01/04/2021,2021-12,12,1,26,All OA; Gold,Article,"Espenhahn, Svenja; Godfrey, Kate J.; Kaur, Sakshi; Ross, Maia; Nath, Niloy; Dmitrieva, Olesya; McMorris, Carly; Cortese, Filomeno; Wright, Charlene; Murias, Kara; Dewey, Deborah; Protzner, Andrea B.; McCrimmon, Adam; Bray, Signe; Harris, Ashley D.","Espenhahn, Svenja (Department of Radiology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary, 2500 University Drive NW, T2N 4N1, Calgary, AB, Canada; Child and Adolescent Imaging Research (CAIR) Program, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Alberta Children’s Hospital Research Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada); Godfrey, Kate J.

Adaptive care plans, delivered by child life specialists, are individualized patient-centered plans created to address the challenges that children with developmental disabilities experience. The current study evaluated if adaptive care plans affect the psychosocial outcomes of children with ASD compared to those with other developmental disabilities. One-hundred and sixty children between 3 and 18 years of age (child’s Mage = 8.10, SD = 3.75) participated. Although children with developmental disabilities who had adaptive care plans did not generally experience less psychosocial distress; children with ASD who had adaptive care plans experienced fewer challenges with anxiety and coping compared to children with ASD who did not have adaptive care plans.","The author would like to thank the child life specialists (Kerri Birkett, Emily Jones, Lauren Straub, Leslie Miller, Emily Patrick, Haley Luedeke, Kitty O’Brien, Katie McEwen, and Penny Grubbs) who supported this work.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Adaptation, Psychological; Ambulatory Care Facilities; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Developmental Disabilities; Humans",28/10/2020,2020,28/10/2020,2021-09,51,9,3028-3038,All OA; Green,Article,"Liddle, Melissa; Sonnentag, Tammy L.","Liddle, Melissa (School of Psychology, Xavier University, 3800 Victory Parkway, 45207, Cincinnati, OH, USA; Cincinnati Children’s Hospital Medical Center, 3333 Burnet Avenue, 45229, Cincinnati, OH, USA); Sonnentag, Tammy L.

The Program for the Education and Enrichment of Relational Skills (PEERS® ) is a well-established parent-assisted intervention for adolescents, which addresses key areas of social functioning. PEERS® has been mainly studied in North-America and its evaluations were mostly questionnaire based. The aim of the current study was to test the effectiveness of the adapted and translated Hebrew version of the PEERS® intervention in a randomized controlled trial, using behavioral measures of peer interaction, in addition to self, parent, and teacher reports. Forty-one participants with ASD and no intellectual impairment, aged 12-17 years, were randomly assigned to an immediate intervention or a delayed-intervention group. All participants were assessed before and after the immediate intervention, and again at follow up, after the delayed intervention took place. Results revealed intervention-related behavioral improvements on adolescents' engagement, question-asking, and physical arousal. Parental reports indicated improved social skills, and reduced ASD symptoms. Adolescents reported on more social encounters, greater empathy, and scored higher on social-skill knowledge. Most of these effects maintained at a 16-week follow-up. Teacher reports' yielded effects only on pre-post intervention analysis. Adolescents' improvement on behavioral engagement predicted parent-reported social skills improvement. Our findings support the effectiveness of the adapted Hebrew version of PEERS® for adolescents with ASD, through significant behavioral and questionnaire-based outcomes, which maintained at follow-up.

LAY SUMMARY: Social-skills groups, which facilitate key social deficits characteristic of ASD, are a popular intervention for adolescents with ASD. Indeed, many treatment protocols have been published, and some have also been research validated. However, there have been inconsistent findings regarding the effectiveness of different protocols, in addition to limited findings of improvement beyond questionnaire reports. This study evaluated the Hebrew adaptation of the PEERS® intervention, a 16-weeks long program, which involves the parents as their adolescents' social coaches. Following the intervention, adolescents improved their social-skills, participated more in social encounters, reported greater empathy, and demonstrated higher social-skill knowledge. A live play-role assessment with an unfamiliar peer indicated that adolescents showed greater involvement, asked more questions and were more physically relaxed during the conversation. Improvements maintained 16 weeks after the intervention was completed.","We are grateful to the Bait Echad centers of the Association for Children at Risk, for their support in running the PEERS® groups, and to Roni Navon, Elisheva Miron, Roni Golan, Hanale Gilberg, Shulamit Deitch, Noa Reinhardt, Lior Weil, Anat Chomsky and Heli Cohen for assisting with data collection and coding.

Sulforaphane, a supplement with indirect antioxidant effects that are derived from broccoli sprouts and seeds, was recently shown to lead to improvements in behavior and social responsiveness in children with ASD. We conducted the current open-label study to determine if we could identify changes in urinary metabolites that were associated with clinical improvements with the goal of identifying a potential mechanism of action.MethodsChildren and young adults enrolled in a school for children with ASD and related neurodevelopmental disorders were recruited to participate in a 12-week, open-label study of sulforaphane. Fasting urinary metabolites and measures of behavior (Aberrant Behavior Checklist—ABC) and social responsiveness (Social Responsiveness Scale—SRS) were measured at baseline and at the end of the study. Pearson’s correlation coefficient was calculated for the pre- to post-intervention change in each of the two clinical scales (ABS and SRS) versus the change in each metabolite.ResultsFifteen children completed the 12-week study. Mean scores on both symptom measures showed improvements (decreases) over the study period, but only the change in the SRS was significant. The ABC improved − 7.1 points (95% CI − 17.4 to 3.2), and the SRS improved − 9.7 points (95% CI − 18.7 to − 0.8). We identified 77 urinary metabolites that were correlated with changes in symptoms, and they clustered into pathways of oxidative stress, amino acid/gut microbiome, neurotransmitters, hormones, and sphingomyelin metabolism.ConclusionsUrinary metabolomics analysis is a useful tool to identify pathways that may be involved in the mechanism of action of treatments targeting abnormal physiology in ASD.Trial registrationThis study was prospectively registered at clinicaltrials.gov (NCT02654743) on January 11, 2016.","We wish to express our deep appreciation for the participating families, who graciously volunteered their time and energy to advance research.

A secondary aim was to consider the possible impact of geographic, cultural/ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates and on clinical presentation of PDD. Based on the evidence reviewed, the median of prevalence estimates of autism spectrum disorders was 62/10 000. While existing estimates are variable, the evidence reviewed does not support differences in PDD prevalence by geographic region nor of a strong impact of ethnic/cultural or socioeconomic factors. However, power to detect such effects is seriously limited in existing data sets, particularly in low-income countries. While it is clear that prevalence estimates have increased over time and these vary in different neighboring and distant regions, these findings most likely represent broadening of the diagnostic concets, diagnostic switching from other developmental disabilities to PDD, service availability, and awareness of autistic spectrum disorders in both the lay and professional public. The lack of evidence from the majority of the world's population suggests a critical need for further research and capacity building in low- and middle-income countries.","WHO commissioned and supported this review.

As a consequence, research on the broader life course of an autism spectrum condition (ASC) has largely been neglected and almost nothing is known about ASC beyond middle age. Differences in brain connectivity that arise during early development may be maintained across the lifespan and may play protective or detrimental roles in older age.MethodThis study explored age-related differences in functional connectivity across middle and older age in clinically diagnosed autistic adults (n = 44, 30–73 years) and in an age-matched typical comparison group (n = 45).ResultsThe results indicated parallel age-related associations in ASC and typical aging for the local efficiency and connection strength of the default mode network and for the segregation of the frontoparietal control network. In contrast, group differences in visual network connectivity are compatible with a safeguarding interpretation of less age-related decline in brain function in ASC. This divergence was mirrored in different associations between visual network connectivity and reaction time variability in the ASC and comparison group.LimitationsThe study is cross-sectional and may be affected by cohort effects. As all participants received their autism diagnosis in adulthood, this might hinder generalizability.ConclusionThese results highlight the complexity of aging in ASC with both parallel and divergent trajectories across different aspects of functional network organization.","The authors would also like to thank all participants for their time and contribution.

Emerging evidence suggests that prenatal diet may also play a role in the etiology autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This review summarizes studies published in English that examined prenatal nutrients or maternal diet in association with ASD from PubMed as of July 2020. Thiry-six studies from nine countries were included in this systematic review; these focused on multivitamin (n = 5), prenatal vitamin (n = 3), folic acid (FA; n = 14), Vitamin D (n = 11), polyunsaturated fatty acid or fish/supplement intake (n = 7), iron (n = 3), Vitamin B12 (n = 1), calcium (n = 1), magnesium (n = 1), and broad maternal dietary habits (n = 3). Overall, higher or moderate intake of prenatal/multivitamin, FA, and Vitamin D was associated with reductions in odds of ASD, though results have not been uniform and there is a need to clarify differences in findings based on biomarkers versus reported intake. Evidence was inconclusive or insufficient for other nutrients. Differences in the timing and measurement of these dietary factors, as well as potential residual confounding, may contribute to existing discrepancies. Key areas for future research to better understand the role of maternal diet in ASD include the need to address potential critical windows, examine the combined effect of multiple nutrients, and consider interactions with genetic or environmental factors. LAY SUMMARY: Maternal diet during pregnancy is important for child neurodevelopment. We reviewed 36 studies examining maternal diet and autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and found that prenatal vitamin/multivitamin use and adequate intake of folic acid and Vitamin D were each associated with lower likelihood of having a child with ASD. Future studies on these and other dietary factors are needed to better understand the role of maternal diet in the development of ASD.

The primary outcome is the proportion of children attaining satisfactory sedation. One hundred and thirty-six children received intranasal dexmedetomidine and 139 received intranasal dexmedetomidine with buccal midazolam for sedation. Combination of intranasal dexmedetomidine and buccal midazolam was associated with higher sedation success when compared to intranasal dexmedetomidine.

No studies explored atypical lateralization in toddlers and its correlation with clinical severity of ASD. We recruited a cohort of 20 subjects aged 36 months or younger receiving a first clinical diagnosis of ASD (15 males; age range 20-36 months). Patients underwent diffusion MRI (High-Angular-Resolution Diffusion Imaging protocol). Data from cortical parcellation were combined with tractography to obtain a connection matrix and diffusion indexes (DI ) including mean fractional anisotropy (DFA ), number of tracts (DNUM ), and total tract length (DTTL ). A laterality index was generated for each measure, and then correlated with the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule-Generic (ADOS-G) total score. Laterality indexes of DFA were significantly correlated with ADOS-G total scores only in two intrafrontal connected areas (correlation was positive in one case and negative in the other). Laterality indexes of DTTL and DNUM showed significant negative correlations (P < 0.05) in six connected areas, mainly fronto-temporal. This study provides first evidence of a significant correlation between brain lateralization of diffusion indexes and clinical severity in toddlers with a first diagnosis of ASD. Significant correlations mainly involved regions within the fronto-temporal circuits, known to be crucial for sociocommunicative skills. It is of interest that all correlations but one were negative, suggesting an inversion of the typical left-right asymmetry in subjects with most severe clinical impairment.",S.C. was partially supported by the Italian Ministry of Health and by Tuscany Region with the grant “GR‐2010‐2317873.” S.M. was partially supported by the Italian Ministry of Health with the grant “GR‐2008‐1143201.”,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806","Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child, Preschool; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Female; Functional Laterality; Humans; Infant; Male; Neural Pathways; Prospective Studies; Severity of Illness Index",17/08/2015,2015,17/08/2015,2016-03,9,3,382-392,Closed,Article,"Conti, Eugenia; Calderoni, Sara; Gaglianese, Anna; Pannek, Kerstin; Mazzotti, Sara; Rose, Stephen; Scelfo, Danilo; Tosetti, Michela; Muratori, Filippo; Cioni, Giovanni; Guzzetta, Andrea","Conti, Eugenia (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Italy.); Calderoni, Sara (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.); Gaglianese, Anna (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.); Pannek, Kerstin (The Australian eHealth Research Centre, CSIRO, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.); Mazzotti, Sara (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.); Rose, Stephen (The Australian eHealth Research Centre, CSIRO, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia.); Scelfo, Danilo (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.); Tosetti, Michela (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.); Muratori, Filippo (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Italy.); Cioni, Giovanni (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Italy.); Guzzetta, Andrea (Department of Developmental Neuroscience, Stella Maris Scientific Institute, Pisa, Italy.; Department of Clinical and Experimental Medicine, University of Pisa, Italy.)","Conti, Eugenia (University of Pisa; University of Pisa)","Conti, Eugenia (University of Pisa; University of Pisa); Calderoni, Sara (University of Pisa); Gaglianese, Anna (University of Pisa); Pannek, Kerstin (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation); Mazzotti, Sara (University of Pisa); Rose, Stephen (Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation); Scelfo, Danilo (University of Pisa); Tosetti, Michela (University of Pisa); Muratori, Filippo (University of Pisa; University of Pisa); Cioni, Giovanni (University of Pisa; University of Pisa); Guzzetta, Andrea (University of Pisa; University of Pisa)",University of Pisa; Commonwealth Scientific and Industrial Research Organisation,grid.5395.a; grid.1016.6,Italy; Australia,Ministero della Salute,26,12,1.24,3.79,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1019149913,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,

To ease referral burden on providers, we adapted the Best Practice Alert (BPA) in the EPIC Electronic Health Record and assessed its utility in recruiting pediatric patients with autism spectrum disorder for the national SPARK study. During a year-long surveillance, 1203 (64.0%) patients were Interested in SPARK and 223 enrolled. Another 754 participants not recruited via the BPA also enrolled; 35.5% of these participants completed their participation compared to 58.3% of BPA-referred participants. Results suggest that (a) a BPA can successfully engage providers in the study-referral process and (b) families who learn about research through their providers may be more engaged and effectively retained.","The authors express their thanks to the SPARK team at the Simons Foundation, the SPARK clinical sites, and the SPARK cohort participants.

This study provides a detailed acoustic characterization of the specificities of speech in individuals with ASD using an extensive sample of speech data, from the production of narratives and from spontaneous conversation. Syllable-level analyses (30,843 tokens in total) were performed on audio recordings from two sub-tasks of the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule from 20 adults with ASD and 20 pairwise matched neuro-typical adults, providing acoustic measures of fundamental frequency, jitter, shimmer and the first three formants.

The ‘prenatal sex steroid’ hypothesis links excessive sex-steroid exposure during foetal life with the behavioural differences observed in ASD. However, the reason why sex steroid exposure may be excessive remains unclear. Epidemiological studies have identified several environmental risk factors associated with ASD, including developmental vitamin D (DVD) deficiency. We have demonstrated in an animal model that DVD-deficiency is associated with a hyper-inflammatory response in placentas from male but not female foetuses. Vitamin D also regulates the expression of several steroidogenic enzymes in vitro. Therefore using this animal model, we have examined whether DVD-deficiency leads to increased sex-steroid levels in both the maternal and foetal compartments.MethodsFemale rats are fed a vitamin D deficient diet from 6 weeks before mating until tissue collection at embryonic day 18. We examined the levels of testosterone, androstenedione and corticosterone in maternal plasma, foetal brains and amniotic fluid. We further examined gene expressions of steroidogenic enzymes and DNA methylation of aromatase promoters in foetal brains as a potential molecular mechanism regulating testosterone expression.ResultsWe show that DVD-deficiency increases testosterone levels in maternal blood. We also show elevated levels of testosterone and androstenedione in the amniotic fluid of female but not male DVD-deficient foetuses. Testosterone levels were also elevated in DVD-deficient male brains. Vitamin D, like other steroid-related hormones, regulates gene expression via methylation. Therefore we examined whether the significant elevation in testosterone in male brains was due to such a potential gene-silencing mechanism. We show that the promoter of aromatase was hyper-methylated compared to male controls.LimitationsA reduction in aromatase, in addition to causing excessive testosterone, could also lead to a reduction in estradiol which was not examined here.ConclusionsThis study is the first to show how an epidemiologically established environmental risk factor for ASD may selectively elevate testosterone in male embryonic brains. These findings provide further mechanistic support for the prenatal sex steroid theory of ASD.",The authors would like to acknowledge Ms Pauline Ko and all the animal house staff for their assistance and contribution to this project.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Amniotic Fluid; Animals; Brain; Female; Fetus; Gene Expression Regulation, Developmental; Male; Models, Biological; Rats, Sprague-Dawley; Testosterone; Vitamin D Deficiency",10/12/2020,2020,10/12/2020,2020-12,11,1,96,All OA; Gold,Article,"Ali, Asad Amanat; Cui, Xiaoying; Pertile, Renata Aparecida Nedel; Li, Xiang; Medley, Gregory; Alexander, Suzanne Adele; Whitehouse, Andrew J.

In experiment 1, we used a new two-alternative-forced-choice method with a roving pedestal designed to minimise cognitive biases. Here, children judged which of two comparison stimuli was most similar in size to a reference stimulus. In experiments 2 and 3, we used methods previously used with autistic populations. In experiment 2, children judged whether stimuli were the ‘same’ or ‘different’, and in experiment 3, we used a method-of-adjustment task.ResultsAcross all tasks, autistic children were equally susceptible to the Ebbinghaus illusion as typically developing children. Autistic children showed a heightened susceptibility to the Müller-Lyer illusion, but only in the method-of-adjustment task. This result may reflect differences in decisional criteria.ConclusionsOur results are inconsistent with theories proposing reduced contextual integration in autism and suggest that previous reports of altered susceptibility to illusions may arise from differences in decision-making, rather than differences in perception per se. Our findings help to elucidate the underlying reasons for atypical responses to perceptual illusions in autism and call for the use of methods that reduce cognitive bias when measuring illusion susceptibility.","We are extremely grateful to all the participants and families who participated in this research, to Abigail Croydon, Louise Neil and members of the CRAE team for help with testing, to Themis Karaminis for programming assistance and to Joshua Solomon and Kai Schreiber for helpful discussions.",Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Adolescent; Autistic Disorder; Child; Female; Humans; Male; Optical Illusions; Pattern Recognition, Visual; Photic Stimulation; Size Perception",23/03/2017,2017,23/03/2017,2017-12,8,1,16,All OA; Gold,Article,"Manning, Catherine; Morgan, Michael J.; Allen, Craig T.

We also know that poorer mental health among parents of autistic children has been observed across different cultures. Most research focuses on Western cultures, so we know little about parental mental health and well-being of parents from different cultural backgrounds; yet, it is likely that cultural background contributes to how parents view their child's condition and respond to the diagnosis. Here, we compared mental health, quality of life and well-being between families raising an autistic child from Australian backgrounds to families from South-East Asian backgrounds. All children in the current study were receiving the same community-based early intervention. When compared to the general population, parents had poorer mental health overall, but there were no differences between the two groups of parents. However, parents from South-East Asian backgrounds reported higher well-being and fewer difficulties associated with their child's autism. These findings suggest that cultural background likely influences not only parent's view of, and response to, their child's autism, but also their own sense of well-being. As researchers and clinicians working with families of autistic children, we should more explicitly consider family's cultural background within our work.","The authors thank the children and their caregivers for their participation, as well as staff at the Victorian Autism Specific Early Learning and Care Centre for facilitating data collection activities.

All these factors may influence the healthcare services that autistic adults use. In this review, we searched six electronic research databases to gather the most recent evidence about how often autistic adults use five important healthcare services (the emergency department, hospitalization, outpatient mental health, preventive services, and primary care) compared to populations of non-autistic adults. A total of 16 articles were ultimately included in this review. Most articles found that autistic adults had equal or higher use of healthcare services than non-autistic adults. Autistic adults frequently used the emergency department and hospital. This may indicate that routine outpatient care in the community is not meeting their needs. Our findings show the importance of improving care at this level for autistic adults to reduce overuse of the emergency department (in this article referred to as ED) and hospital.","The authors would like to thank Anna Biszaha, MLIS for her contributions to this work.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Delivery of Health Care; Health Personnel; Humans; Referral and Consultation,09/12/2021,2021,09/12/2021,2022-02,26,2,317-331,Closed,Article,"Gilmore, Daniel; Krantz, Morgan; Weaver, Lindy; Hand, Brittany N","Gilmore, Daniel (The Ohio State University, USA); Krantz, Morgan (The Ohio State University, USA); Weaver, Lindy (The Ohio State University, USA); Hand, Brittany N (The Ohio State University, USA)","Gilmore, Daniel (The Ohio State University)","Gilmore, Daniel (The Ohio State University); Krantz, Morgan (The Ohio State University); Weaver, Lindy (The Ohio State University); Hand, Brittany N (The Ohio State University)",The Ohio State University,grid.261331.4,United States,,1,1,,,25,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1143749393,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,3 Good Health and Well Being,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=213499,Systematic Review,

Mindfulness-based and acceptance and commitment therapy (ACT)-based interventions can improve their mental well-being. This review examined the effectiveness of mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions in improving mental well-being and mindfulness among parents of children with developmental disabilities. Six electronic databases were searched, resulting in the inclusion of ten studies published between 2014 and 2020. Meta-analysis was conducted using the random-effect model. The results suggest that mindfulness-based and ACT-based interventions were effective in decreasing parental stress, anxiety and depression, however, the effectiveness of these interventions in increasing parental mindfulness was inconclusive. Based on these findings, we discussed considerations for implementing interventions and identified areas which warrant further research.","The authors would like to thank the National University Health System, Research Support Unit, for assistance in the language editing of this manuscript.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Acceptance and Commitment Therapy; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Developmental Disabilities; Humans; Mental Health; Mindfulness; Parents,28/06/2021,2021,28/06/2021,2022-06,52,6,2770-2783,All OA; Bronze,Article,"Chua, Joelle Yan Xin; Shorey, Shefaly","Chua, Joelle Yan Xin (Nursing Division, KK Women’s and Children’s Hospital, Singapore, Singapore); Shorey, Shefaly (Alice Lee Centre for Nursing Studies, Yong Loo Lin School of Medicine, National University of Singapore, Level 2, Clinical Research Centre, Block MD11, 10 Medical Drive, 117597, Singapore, Singapore)","Shorey, Shefaly (National University of Singapore)","Chua, Joelle Yan Xin (KK Women's and Children's Hospital); Shorey, Shefaly (National University of Singapore)",KK Women's and Children's Hospital; National University of Singapore,grid.414963.d; grid.4280.e,Singapore; Singapore,,2,2,,,1,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10803-021-04893-1.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139193065,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=191783,Systematic Review,

The present study investigated the processing of spectral and temporal information in 12 adolescents with ASD and 15 age-matched controls. Participants completed two psychoacoustic tasks: one determined frequency difference limens, and the other determined gap detection thresholds. Results showed impaired frequency discrimination at the highest standard frequency in the ASD group but no overall difference between groups. However, when groups were defined by auditory hyper-sensitivity, a group difference arose. For the gap detection task, the ASD group demonstrated elevated thresholds. This supports previous research demonstrating a deficit in ASD in temporal perception and suggests a connection between hyper-sensitivity and frequency discrimination abilities.","Preparation of this manuscript was supported by a postdoctoral fellowship from the American Association of University Women to AB, as well as funds from the The Help Group—UCLA Autism Research Alliance and the Children’s Music Fund.

This study investigated if atypical white matter microstructure in the brain mediated the relationship between motor skills and ASD symptom severity. Sixty-seven males with ASD and 42 males with typical development (5–33 years old) completed a diffusion tensor imaging scan and measures of grip strength, finger tapping, and autism symptom severity. Within the ASD group, weaker grip strength predicted more severe autism symptoms. Fractional anisotropy of the brainstem’s corticospinal tract predicted both grip strength and autism symptom severity and mediated the relationship between the two. These findings suggest that brainstem white matter may contribute to autism symptoms and grip strength in ASD.","This work was supported by the National Institute of Mental Health [RO1 MH080826 to JEL, ALA, NL, EDB; RO1 MH084795 to JEL, NL], the Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development [T32 HD07489 to BGT, and P30 HD003352 to the Waisman Center], the Hartwell Foundation [to BGT], the Poelman Foundation [to EDB].

Given the substantial public health implications on this topic, here, we presented an updated meta-analysis of the association between maternal antidepressant use during pregnancy and ASD. Cochrane Library, EMBASE, PsycINFO, and PubMed databases were systematically searched. A random effects model was used to pool the adjusted relative risk (RR) for cohort studies and the adjusted odds ratio (OR) for case-control studies as well as their corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CIs). Meta-analysis restricted to sibling studies was also conducted. Publication bias was systematically assessed. Fourteen studies were identified (eight cohort studies and six case-control studies). Pooled adjusted RR for cohort studies (n = 2,839,980) was 1.13 (0.93–1.39) showed a non-significant association; while two studies were potentially missing from the test of publication bias, filled estimates also showed a non-significant association (filled RR 0.97, 95% CI 0.79–1.19). Pooled OR was 1.51 (1.15–1.99) for case-control studies (n = 117,737) showed a significant association; two studies were potentially missing; however, the filled estimates suggested a non-significant association (filled OR 1.26, 95% CI 0.98–1.62). Analyses restricted to sibling studies also showed a non-significant association (RR 0.99, 95% CI 0.81–1.22).

By integrating genetic and clinical data in a sample of 176 ASD participants, we tested the hypothesis that OXT is a marker for abnormal prenatal development which leads to impairments in the process of labor. OXT-exposed ASD had more obstetric complications (P = 0.031), earlier onset of symptoms (P = 0.027), poorer cognitive development (P = 0.011), higher mutation burden across neurodevelopment genes (P = 0.020; OR = 5.33) and lower transmission of polygenic risk for ASD (P = 0.0319), than non-exposed ASD. OXT seems to constitute a risk indicator rather than a risk factor for ASD, which is relevant for diagnostic and genetic counselling.","This work was supported by the Spanish Ministry of Science, Innovation and Universities, Instituto de Salud Carlos III (FIS PI14/02103 and FIS PI17/00819), co-financed by ERDF Funds from the European Commission, “A way of making Europe,” CIBERSAM, Madrid Regional Government (B2017/BMD-3740 AGES-CM-2), European Union Structural Funds and European Union Seventh Framework Program and H2020 Program; Fundación Familia Alonso, Fundación Alicia Koplowitz and Fundación Mutua Madrileña.

Applied behavioral analytic intervention is proved to be effective in improving their cognitive abilities, language skills, and social and emotional skills, but the service delivery between developed and developing countries is different. A qualitative study was conducted to explore personal experiences with actual practice fidelity of behavior analytic services for children with autism in a Western developed country (United Kingdom) and an Eastern developing country (China). The study found: (1) a lack of support for autism and behavioral analytic services in both countries; (2) applied behavioral analytic intervention was not as widely endorsed by healthcare or educational systems in the United Kingdom; Chinese parents faced challenges around inclusive education and accessing high-quality services and there was a social stigma attached to autism; (3) a limited awareness and application of early intensive behavior intervention in both regions; and (4) intervention fidelity with regards to the practice of one particular aspect of behavioral analytic interventions was similar and increased with ongoing training. This study emphasizes the need to support children with autism, and to consider regional adaptations of evidence-based practice of behavior analytic interventions for the affected population.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; China; Humans; Parents; Policy; United Kingdom,08/06/2021,2021,08/06/2021,2022-01,26,1,101-120,All OA; Green,Article,"Liao, Yini; Dillenburger, Karola; Hu, Xiaoyi","Liao, Yini (Sun Yat-Sen University, China); Dillenburger, Karola (Queen’s University Belfast, UK); Hu, Xiaoyi (Beijing Normal University, China)","Liao, Yini (Sun Yat-sen University)","Liao, Yini (Sun Yat-sen University); Dillenburger, Karola (Queen's University Belfast); Hu, Xiaoyi (Beijing Normal University)",Sun Yat-sen University; Queen's University Belfast; Beijing Normal University,grid.12981.33; grid.4777.3; grid.20513.35,China; United Kingdom; China,National Natural Science Foundation of China,2,2,,,1,https://pureadmin.qub.ac.uk/ws/files/238075172/ABA_IN_UK_AND_CHINA.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1138690430,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,4 Quality Education,No,,,

Parent-Child Interaction Therapy shows promise for treating disruptive behaviors in children with autism spectrum disorder. Treatment processes (i.e. treatment length and homework compliance), parenting skills, parenting stress, and behavioral outcomes (i.e. disruptive and externalizing behaviors and executive functioning) were compared in 16 children with autism spectrum disorder and 16 children without autism spectrum disorder matched on gender, age, and initial intensity of disruptive behaviors. Samples were statistically similar in terms of child receptive language, child race and ethnicity, parent age, gender and education, and number of two-parent families in treatment. Families received standard, mastery-based Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. Both groups demonstrated significant and clinically meaningful improvements in child disruptive and externalizing behavior and executive functioning, parenting skills, and parenting stress. Length of treatment, homework compliance, and parent and child outcomes did not differ significantly between groups. A subset of children with autism spectrum disorder also showed significant improvements in social responsiveness, adaptive skills, and restricted/repetitive behaviors. This study replicates and extends prior research by demonstrating that children with and without autism spectrum disorder experience similar benefits following Parent-Child Interaction Therapy. Findings may expand the availability and dissemination of time-limited, evidence-based interventions for autism spectrum disorder and comorbid disruptive behaviors.","The authors would like to thank Cecilia Alvarez-Tabio, Amy Beaumont, and Paige Siper for their clinical services and Jamie Sherman and Whitney Gealy for reliability coding.

The same child can give too much information in one context (e.g. saying 'the big cup' with only one cup present) and too little information in another context (e.g. entering a room and announcing 'the red one' when the listener has no prior knowledge regarding what this refers to). We asked whether many autistic children particularly struggle to tailor their language appropriately in situations where this means changing how they have previously described something. That is, if a speaker has recently described an object as 'the cup', the need to switch to describing it as 'the big cup' could hinder the speaker's ability to use language in a context-appropriate way. We found that switching descriptions indeed makes it more difficult for children to use language in a context-appropriate way, but that this effect did not play out differently for autistic versus neuro-typical children. Autistic children were, however, less likely to provide a context-appropriate amount of information overall than were neuro-typical peers. The combination of these effects meant that when object re-description was required, autistic children only produced an appropriate description half the time. In contrast, without a requirement to re-describe, autistic children could indeed take listener informational needs into account. Applied professionals should consider whether a requirement to change the way the child has previously said something may hinder a child's ability to communicate effectively.","The authors thank Frank Gasking for technical assistance.

Caregiver responsiveness, which has been linked to positive social communication outcomes, has not been adequately examined with regard to infant sensory reactivity. This study examined the multiplicative impact of infant sensory hypo- and hyperreactivity on caregiver responsiveness to sensory reactivity and regulation cues in 43 infants at elevated likelihood of autism. Sensory hyperreactivity was found to moderate the association between sensory hyporeactivity and caregiver responsiveness, such that caregivers of infants with moderately high sensory hypo- and hyperreactivity demonstrated higher responsiveness.","We would like to thank the research teams at University of North Carolina, Chapel Hill and University of Southern California for their diligent efforts in data collection, management, and coding for the larger study from which these data were drawn.

However, negative BOLD responses (NBR) associated with language and inhibitory processes have been less studied in ASD. In this study, functional magnetic resonance imaging showed that the NBR in ASD participants was reduced during passive listening to spoken narratives compared to control participants. Further, functional connectivity between the superior temporal gyrus and regions that exhibited a NBR during receptive language in control participants was increased in ASD participants. These findings extend models for receptive language disability in ASD to include anomalous neural deactivations and connectivity consistent with reduced or poorly modulated inhibitory processes.","Authors are grateful for significant contributions by students and subjects who have participated in the development of this project, including Grace Lai (Columbia University Graduate Program in Neuroscience) and Spiro Pantazatos (Columbia University Graduate Program in Physiology and Cellular Biophysics), and for mentoring guidance, Jay Edelman (The City College of College [A.K]).

Therefore, this study used behavioral testing and parent reports of 60 children with autism to investigate the interplay of emotion misinterpretation and hostile attribution bias in the prediction of different aggressive behaviors. Further, the additional impact of dysfunctional emotion regulation was examined. Path analyses indicated that hostile attribution bias increased verbal and covert aggression but not physical aggression and bullying. Dysfunctional emotion regulation had an additional impact on bullying, verbal aggression, and covert aggression. Emotion recognition was positively associated with hostile attribution bias. These findings provide a first insight into a complex interplay of socio-emotional variables; longitudinal studies are needed to examine causal relationships.","The authors thank the children and their caregivers who made this research possible.

The empirical literature, however, is characterized by inconsistent findings concerning which aspects of gait are affected. We conducted a meta-analysis to summarize study findings that examined temporal and spatial (i.e., two-dimensional) gait parameters in pediatric and adult samples comprising individuals with autism and healthy controls. After searching electronic databases, a total of 18 studies were identified and included in this review. Results from the meta-analyses revealed autism is associated with a wider step width, slower walking speed, longer gait cycle, longer stance time and longer step time. Additionally, autism appears to be associated with greater intra-individual variability on measures of stride length, stride time and walking speed. Meta-regression analyses revealed cadence and gait cycle duration differences, between autism and control groups, become more pronounced with age. Overall, this review demonstrates that autism is associated with gait abnormalities. However, assessment of the methodological quality of the studies reveal, additional research is required to understand the extent that gait abnormalities are specifically linked to autism, or whether they may be secondary to other factors commonly found in this group, such as increased weight. LAY SUMMARY: It is often noted by clinicians that individuals with autism have an awkward or unusual walking style, which is also referred to as gait. In this report, we reviewed past studies that compared gait in individuals with and without autism. Our review indicates autism is associated with an abnormal gait. However, it is not yet clear whether gait abnormalities are caused by autism, or arise due to other factors such as heavier weight, which often co-occurs in this group.","Rujuta B.

However, little is known about why this is the case. At two timepoints during the pandemic, we asked 149 autistic and 147 non-autistic adults about feelings of anxiety, depression, and stress, and about characteristics that may explain why some (autistic) people have a larger chance of developing anxiety and depression during this pandemic. In our study, autistic adults experienced more anxiety and depression than non-autistic adults. Across autistic and non-autistic individuals, the people who experienced more stress at timepoint 1 experienced more anxiety and depression 4 months later. This was especially the case for those individuals who use maladaptive coping styles, such as denial or venting, and for those who have difficulties dealing with uncertain situations. Our findings show the burden of the COVID-19 pandemic on the mental health of autistic adults. Interventions to support autistic adults during and after the pandemic are needed, and they may want to focus on the negative impact of stress and teach autistic (and non-autistic) adults more adaptive ways to cope with stressful circumstances.",The authors are extremely grateful to all individuals who have dedicated their time participating in this study.

It is thought to use simulation, whereby the observers use their own motor system to predict the observed actions. As individuals diagnosed with autism are characterized by difficulties understanding the actions of others and motor coordination issues, it is possible that action prediction ability is altered in this population. This study compared action prediction ability between 20 autistic and 22 non-autistic adults using an occlusion paradigm. Participants watched different videos of a female actor carrying out everyday actions. During each video, the action was transiently occluded by a gray rectangle for 1000 ms. During occlusions, the video was allowed to continue as normal or was moved forward (i.e., appearing to continue too far ahead) or moved backwards (i.e., appearing to continue too far behind). Participants were asked to indicate after each occlusion whether the action continued with the correct timing or was too far ahead/behind. Autistic individuals were less accurate than non-autistic individuals, particularly when the video was too far behind. A trend analysis suggested that autistic participants were more likely to judge too far behind occlusions as being in time. These preliminary results suggest that prediction ability may be altered in autistic adults, potentially due to slower simulation or a delayed onset of these processes. LAY SUMMARY: When we observe other people performing everyday actions, we use their movements to help us understand and predict what they are doing. In this study, we found that autistic compared to non-autistic adults were slightly less accurate at predicting other people's actions. These findings help to unpick the different ways that social understanding is affected in autism.","The study was supported by the University of Manchester “Investing in Success” fund, awarded to Dr. Emma Gowen and Dr. Ellen Poliakoff.

Integrating a social-humanoid robot within the standard clinical treatment has been proven promising. The main aim of this randomised controlled study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a robot-assisted psychosocial intervention and the secondary aim was to investigate potential differences between a robot-assisted intervention group and a control group receiving intervention by humans only. The analysis of the results showed that robot-assisted intervention could be beneficial by improving children’s psychosocial skills. This improvement was highlighted by neuropsychological testing and parent reporting. Group comparison only presented minimal statistically significant differences.

Studies were included if they (1) either (a) measured autism spectrum disorder characteristics using a metric that yielded a single score quantification of the magnitude of autism spectrum disorder characteristics and/or (b) studied individuals with an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis compared to individuals without an autism spectrum disorder diagnosis and (2) measured Big Five traits in the same sample or samples. Fourteen reviewed studies include both correlational analyses and group comparisons. Eighteen effect sizes per Big Five trait were used to calculate two overall effect sizes per trait. Meta-analytic effects were calculated using random effects models. Twelve effects (per trait) from nine studies reporting correlations yielded a negative association between each Big Five personality trait and autism spectrum disorder characteristics (Fisher's z ranged from -.21 (conscientiousness) to -.50 (extraversion)). Six group contrasts (per trait) from six studies comparing individuals diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder to neurotypical individuals were also substantial (Hedges' g ranged from -.88 (conscientiousness) to -1.42 (extraversion)).

A conceptual replication of the validation of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire in Dutch adults,"Background Camouflaging behavior is often defined as using strategies to hide autistic characteristics. In this study, we investigated how to measure camouflaging behavior by performing a conceptual replication of the original study of the Camouflaging Autistic Traits Questionnaire (CAT-Q) and testing whether the self-reported camouflaging behavior is measuring the same construct as the second most used manner to measure camouflaging behavior, the discrepancy method. Method In total, 674 individuals (356 autistic) aged 30–92 years, filled out the Dutch translation of the CAT-Q (CAT-Q-NL) and the Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ). In 90 autistic adults the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS-2) was administered. We executed preregistered analyses (AsPredicted #37800) to investigate the factor structure, measurement invariance, internal consistency, convergent validity and group differences. Results Our analyses showed that the original three-factor structure had an acceptable fit and internal consistency ranged from sufficient to good. However, there was no measurement invariance between autistic and non-autistic individuals and correlations between CAT-Q-NL-scores and the discrepancy between AQ and ADOS-2 varied between low to mediocre (r = 0.04 to.28). Conclusions The CAT-Q-NL can be used to measure camouflaging between and within autistic adults, but not between autistic and non-autistic adults and its convergent validity is limited. Despite these caveats, the CAT-Q-NL can serve as a useful addition to the clinical assessment toolbox because gaining insight in the level of camouflaging of autistic adults may help provide better mental health care. However, more research is needed into how to optimally measure the camouflaging construct.","This study was funded by the VICI Grant (grant number: 453–16–006) awarded to HMG by the Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO).

We sought to examine the efficacy and safety of atomoxetine in this population. After screening for inclusion criteria, we identified three randomized placebo controlled trials involving 241 children. We assessed internal validity using standard Cochrane Risk of bias tool for randomized controlled trials (RCTs). We used Revman 5.3 for meta-analysis and GRADE approach to create summary of findings with grading of the quality of evidence. Atomoxetine had a benefit on improving parent-rated hyperactivity (standardized mean difference [SMD] = -0.73, 95% Confidence Interval, CI = -1.15 to -0.34) and parent-rated inattention (SMD = -0.53, 95% CI = -0.93 to -0.12) but the magnitude of effects is uncertain. However, atomoxetine was also associated with increased risk of non-serious adverse effects like nausea and vomiting, decreased sleep, and decreased appetite. Atomoxetine may be effective in improving hyperactivity and inattention in children with autism spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder. However, we are uncertain about the true effect of this intervention and need more RCTs trials designed to evaluate this.

The goal of this study was to evaluate efficacy, safety, and tolerability of oral N-acetylcysteine (NAC), an antioxidant whose function overlaps with proposed mechanisms of ASD pathophysiology, targeting core social impairment in youth with ASD.MethodsThis study was a 12-week randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of oral NAC in youth with ASD. Study participants were medically healthy youth age 4 to 12 years with ASD, weighing ≥15 kg, and judged to be moderately ill based on the Clinical Global Impressions Severity scale. The participants were randomized via computer to active drug or placebo in a 1:1 ratio, with the target dose of NAC being 60 mg/kg/day in three divided doses. The primary outcome measure of efficacy was the Clinical Global Impressions Improvement (CGI-I) scale anchored to core social impairment. To investigate the impact of NAC on oxidative stress markers in peripheral blood, venous blood samples were collected at screen and week 12.ResultsThirty-one patients were enrolled (NAC = 16, placebo = 15). Three participants were lost to follow-up, and three left the trial due to adverse effects. The average daily dose of NAC at week 12 was 56.2 mg/kg (SD = 9.7) with dose ranging from 33.6 to 64.3 mg/kg. The frequency of adverse events was so low that comparisons between groups could not be conducted. At week 12, there was no statistically significant difference between the NAC and placebo groups on the CGI-I (p > 0.69) but the glutathione (GSH) level in blood was significantly higher in the NAC group (p < 0.05). The oxidative glutathione disulfide (GSSG) level increased in the NAC group, however only at a trend level of significance (p = 0.09). There was no significant difference between the NAC and placebo groups in the GSH/GSSG ratio, DNA strand break and oxidative damage, and blood homocysteine levels at week 12 (ps > 0.16).ConclusionsThe results of this trial indicate that NAC treatment was well tolerated, had the expected effect of boosting GSH production, but had no significant impact on social impairment in youth with ASD.Trial registrationClinicaltrails.gov NCT00453180",We would like to acknowledge the contributions of Arlen Kohn MA and Lauren Mathieu-Frasier MA for their assistance with study coordination and data collection.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Acetylcysteine; Administration, Oral; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Comet Assay; DNA Damage; Double-Blind Method; Drug Administration Schedule; Female; Follow-Up Studies; Free Radical Scavengers; Glutathione; Homocysteine; Humans; Male; Oxidation-Reduction; Oxidative Stress; Pilot Projects; Placebo Effect; Social Behavior",21/04/2016,2016,21/04/2016,2016-12,7,1,26,All OA; Gold,Article,"Wink, Logan K.; Adams, Ryan; Wang, Zemin; Klaunig, James E.; Plawecki, Martin H.; Posey, David J.; McDougle, Christopher J.; Erickson, Craig A.","Wink, Logan K.

Previous studies have shown that a single dose of oxytocin improves speech comprehension in autism. The primary aim of this study was to investigate whether the orientation behaviors toward human sounds are different for neurotypical (NT) adults and adults with ASD and whether oxytocin has an effect on their orientation behaviors toward human sounds.MethodsThis was a randomized, placebo-controlled, within-subject, crossover design study of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in 13 NT adults and 16 adults with ASD. Subjects were randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo on different days, and they were blind to the treatment. The participants then listened passively to human and non-human affective sounds while their skin conductance responses (SCRs) and the changes in peripheral blood vessel constriction were monitored as an indicator of spontaneous orientation. The monitored data were analyzed by a mixed-design ANOVA.ResultsOxytocin enhanced the difference between the SCRs to human and non-human sounds in both the NT and ASD groups (F(1,56) = 6.046, p = 0.017). Further correlation coefficient analysis showed significant correlations between this SCR difference and the scores in the autism spectrum quotient ‘attention to detail’ and ‘social skill’ subscales and interpersonal reactivity index and social functioning scale in the ASD group. Oxytocin was well tolerated, and no serious adverse effects were reported.ConclusionsThe difference in SCRs implies that oxytocin nasal spray may enhance orientation behaviors toward human sounds in the presence of other environmental sounds in both ASD and NT adults.Trial registrationUMIN-CTR Clinical Trial, Unique trial number: UMIN000005809",We would like to thank all the participants for their time and effort.

Similarities between both disorders can lead to misdiagnosis, especially when it comes to average-IQ adults who were not identified during childhood. The aim of this review was to examine the occurrence of SSD in average-IQ adults with ASD. Electronic and manual searches identified a total of 278 references, of which 10 were included in a meta-analysis. The pooled prevalence of SSD in the total ASD sample was close to 6%, pointing to a high co-occurrence of the two conditions. Further research is needed to determine the factors that predispose members of this population to the emergence of psychotic disorders.","This research was conducted as a part of first author’s PhD project.

Despite this, almost all twin studies focus on childhood. This twin study investigated the stability of autistic traits from childhood to early adulthood and explored the degree to which any stability could be explained by genetic or environmental factors.MethodsParents of over 2500 twin pairs completed questionnaires assessing autistic traits when twins were aged either 9 or 12 years and again when twins were aged 18. Bivariate twin analysis assessed the degree of phenotypic and etiological stability in autistic traits across this period. Genetic overlap in autistic traits across development was also tested in individuals displaying a broad ASD phenotype, defined as scoring within the highest 5% of the sample.ResultsAutistic traits displayed moderate phenotypic stability (r = .39). The heritability of autistic traits was 76–77% in childhood and 60–62% in adulthood. A moderate degree of genetic influences on childhood autistic traits were carried across into adulthood (genetic correlation = .49). The majority (85%) of the stability in autistic traits was attributable to genetic factors. Genetic influences on autistic traits were moderately stable from childhood to early adulthood at the extremes (genetic correlation = .64).ConclusionsBroad autistic traits display moderate phenotypic and etiological stability from childhood to early adulthood. Genetic factors accounted for almost all phenotypic stability, although there was some phenotypic and etiological instability in autistic traits. Thus, autistic traits in adulthood are influenced by a combination of enduring and unique genetic factors.","CATSS is funded by the Swedish Research Council for Health, Working Life and Welfare, and the Swedish Research Council.

FXS is caused by an expansion of trinucleotide repeats in the promoter region of the fragile X mental retardation gene (Fmr1). This leads to a lack of fragile X mental retardation protein (FMRP), which regulates translation of a wide range of messenger RNAs (mRNAs). The extent of expression level alterations of synaptic proteins affected by FMRP loss and their consequences on synaptic dynamics in FXS has not been fully investigated.MethodsHere, we used an Fmr1 knockout (KO) mouse model to investigate the molecular mechanisms underlying FXS by monitoring protein expression changes using shotgun label-free liquid-chromatography mass spectrometry (LC-MSE) in brain tissue and synaptosome fractions. FXS-associated candidate proteins were validated using selected reaction monitoring (SRM) in synaptosome fractions for targeted protein quantification. Furthermore, functional alterations in synaptic release and dynamics were evaluated using live-cell imaging, and interpretation of synaptic dynamics differences was investigated using electron microscopy.ResultsKey findings relate to altered levels of proteins involved in GABA-signalling, especially in the cerebellum. Further exploration using microscopy studies found reduced synaptic vesicle unloading of hippocampal neurons and increased vesicle unloading in cerebellar neurons, which suggests a general decrease of synaptic transmission.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that FMRP is a regulator of synaptic vesicle dynamics, which supports the role of FMRP in presynaptic functions. Taken together, these studies provide novel insights into the molecular changes associated with FXS.","This work was supported by the Dutch Organization for Medical Sciences (C.I.D.Z.), Life Sciences (C.I.D.Z.), Social and Behavioral Sciences (C.I.D.Z.), NeuroBasic (C.I.D.Z. and S.B.) and ERC-adv and ERC-POC of the EU (C.I.D.Z.).",Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Animals; Animals, Congenic; Cells, Cultured; Cerebellum; Fluorescent Dyes; Fragile X Mental Retardation Protein; Fragile X Syndrome; Hippocampus; Intravital Microscopy; Male; Mass Spectrometry; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Mice, Knockout; Mice, Neurologic Mutants; Microscopy, Electron; Models, Animal; Nerve Tissue Proteins; Presynaptic Terminals; Proteome; Purkinje Cells; Pyridinium Compounds; Quaternary Ammonium Compounds; Signal Transduction; Synaptic Transmission; Synaptic Vesicles; Synaptosomes",01/03/2016,2016,01/03/2016,2016-12,7,1,17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Broek, Jantine A.

Among autistic individuals without intellectual disability, adaptive functioning is not commensurate with intellectual ability (IQ), and instead a gap exists between these individuals' intellectual ability and their adaptive skills. Further, these autistic individuals show a widening of this gap with increasing age. Existing studies of the gap between IQ and adaptive functioning have studied predominantly male samples. Thus, we do not know if the gap also exists in autistic females. We therefore looked at adaptive functioning and the gap between IQ and adaptive functioning in a large sample of autistic girls and boys without intellectual disability. To disentangle effects of group (autistic vs typically developing) from effects of sex (girls vs boys), we compared autistic girls and boys to one another as well as to their same-sex typically developing peers. Analyses took into consideration differences in IQ between autistic and typically developing youth. We found autistic girls, like autistic boys, show lower adaptive functioning than their same-sex typically developing peers. Results underscore the need to evaluate adaptive functioning in autistic individuals without intellectual disability and to provide necessary supports. The large gap between intellectual ability and socialization skills, in particular, may be of critical importance in improving our understanding of outcomes and mental health difficulties among autistic females.","We extend our gratitude to all of the participating children and families for their commitment and contributions to this project.

Traditional behavioral therapies usually require specialist therapist and be conducted in specific settings, increasing burdens on families and individuals with autism. Physical activity has long been found to promote physical and mental well-beings, and it is more affordable and versatile than traditional therapies. There is preliminary support for the use of physical activity interventions to improve communication and social functioning in individuals with autism. In this study, we quantitatively aggregate data from existing controlled trials to provide an up-to-date inquiry into the effectiveness of physical activity interventions on communication and social functioning in autistic children and adolescents. We included 12 trials involving 350 participants (8 trials reported communication outcomes and 11 trials reported social functioning outcomes) and found small to moderate benefits on communication and social functioning. Further analyses showed that the benefit of physical activity interventions is greater in younger participants. Results of this study suggest that physical activity interventions are effective to improve communication and social functioning in autistic children and adolescents, and early participation in the interventions can be more beneficial.

Emerging data from animal models and genetic association studies as well as early, single-dose intervention studies suggest that the oxytocin system may be a potential therapeutic target for social cognition/function deficits in ASD. The primary aim of this study was to examine the safety/therapeutic effects of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in adults with ASD, with respect to the two core symptom domains of social cognition/functioning and repetitive behaviors.MethodsThis was a pilot, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled, parallel design trial of intranasal oxytocin versus placebo in 19 adults with ASD (16 males; 33.20 ± 13.29 years). Subjects were randomized to 24 IU intranasal oxytocin or placebo in the morning and afternoon for 6 weeks. Measures of social function/cognition (the Diagnostic Analysis of Nonverbal Accuracy) and repetitive behaviors (Repetitive Behavior Scale Revised) were administered. Secondary measures included the Social Responsiveness Scale, Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test and the Yale Brown Obsessive Compulsive Scale – compulsion subscale and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire – emotional/social subscales). Full-information maximum-likelihood parameter estimates were obtained and tested using mixed-effects regression analyses.ResultsAlthough no significant changes were detected in the primary outcome measures after correcting for baseline differences, results suggested improvements after 6 weeks in measures of social cognition (Reading-the-Mind-in-the-Eyes Test, p = 0.002, d = 1.2), and quality of life (World Health Organization Quality of Life Questionnaire – emotion, p = 0.031, d = 0.84), both secondary measures. Oxytocin was well tolerated and no serious adverse effects were reported.ConclusionsThis pilot study suggests that there is therapeutic potential to daily administration of intranasal oxytocin in adults with ASD and that larger and longer studies are warranted.Trial registrationNCT00490802","The authors would like to thank the Seaver Foundation and Holland Bloorview Kids Rehabilitation Hospital Foundation for financial support to this project, as well as the help of Ms Naomi Sklar in the preparation of this manuscript.

In addition, the association between vitamin D deficiencies and gastrointestinal (GI) complains and electroencephalogram (EEG) abnormalities commonly found in children with ASD was investigated. Vitamin D levels in ASD patients were significantly lower. Also, Vitamin D levels in ASD patients had significant correlation with GI complains, but no correlation between vitamin D levels and Ca2+or EEG abnormalities was detected.

423,1028,pub.1141846826,10.1002/aur.2626,34643325,PMC8665129,,Unified framework for early stage status prediction of autism based on infant structural magnetic resonance imaging,"Autism, or autism spectrum disorder (ASD), is a developmental disability that is diagnosed at about 2 years of age based on abnormal behaviors. Existing neuroimaging-based methods for the prediction of ASD typically focus on functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI); however, most of these fMRI-based studies include subjects older than 5 years of age. Due to challenges in the application of fMRI for infants, structural magnetic resonance imaging (sMRI) has increasingly received attention in the field for early status prediction of ASD. In this study, we propose an automated prediction framework based on infant sMRI at about 24 months of age. Specifically, by leveraging an infant-dedicated pipeline, iBEAT V2.0 Cloud, we derived segmentation and parcellation maps from infant sMRI. We employed a convolutional neural network to extract features from pairwise maps and a Siamese network to distinguish whether paired subjects were from the same or different classes. As compared to T1w imaging without segmentation and parcellation maps, our proposed approach with segmentation and parcellation maps yielded greater sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy of ASD prediction, which was validated using two datasets with different imaging protocols/scanners and was confirmed by receiver operating characteristic analysis. Furthermore, comparison with state-of-the-art methods demonstrated the superior effectiveness and robustness of the proposed method. Finally, attention maps were generated to identify subject-specific autism effects, supporting the reasonability of the predictive results. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the utility of our unified framework for the early-stage status prediction of ASD by sMRI. LAY SUMMARY: The status prediction of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) at an early age is highly desirable, as early intervention may significantly reduce autism symptoms. However, current methods for diagnosing young children are limited to behavioral assays. In this study, we propose an automated method for ASD status prediction at the age of 24 months that uses infant structural magnetic resonance imaging to identify neural features.",Data used in the preparation of this work were obtained from the National Database for Autism Research (NDAR).

Compared to typically developing (TD) controls, individuals with ASD exhibit delayed brain responses to upright faces at a face-sensitive event-related potential (ERP), the N170. Given observed differences in patterns of visual attention to faces, it is not known whether slowed neural processing may simply reflect atypical looking to faces. The present study manipulated visual attention to facial features to examine whether directed attention to the eyes normalizes N170 latency in ASD. ERPs were recorded in 30 children and adolescents with ASD as well as 26 TD children and adolescents. Results replicated prior findings of shorter N170 latency to the eye region of the face in TD individuals. In contrast, those with ASD did not demonstrate modulation of N170 latency by point of regard to the face. Group differences in latency were most pronounced when attention was directed to the eyes. Results suggest that well-replicated findings of N170 delays in ASD do not simply reflect atypical patterns of visual engagement with experimental stimuli. These findings add to a body of evidence indicating that N170 delays are a promising marker of atypical neural response to social information in ASD. LAY SUMMARY: This study looks at how children's and adolescents' brains respond when looking at different parts of a face. Typically developing children and adolescents processed eyes faster than other parts of the face, whereas this pattern was not seen in ASD. Children and adolescents with ASD processed eyes more slowly than typically developing children. These findings suggest that observed inefficiencies in face processing in ASD are not simply reflective of failure to attend to the eyes.","This research was supported by NIMH R01 MH100173, NIMH U19 MH108206, and NIMH K23 MH086785 to J.M.

Eye-movements were recorded while 16 autism spectrum children of mixed ability, and 18 typically developing age-matched controls, completed the Gap-Overlap paradigm. A significant difference in latency to fixate target was found between Gap and Overlap conditions. A significant interaction with group was due to autism spectrum participants' shorter latencies to fixate target in the Gap condition, but similar group responses in the Overlap condition. Considerable within-group variability emerged. We predicted that attentional disengaging would be related to specific features of the phenotype; however, there was no evidence of an association with receptive language, non-verbal IQ, sensory behaviors, or autistic severity in autism spectrum or typically developing groups. In conclusion, while atypical visual attention mechanisms may be a feature of autism spectrum, this is not explained by impaired visual disengaging but is more likely due to increased susceptibility of visual fixation offset cueing. Despite best efforts, nine additional autism spectrum children could not complete testing, and data from a further six were unusable; more work is needed to develop research methods that enable individuals across the spectrum to participate.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Attention; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child, Preschool; Cues; Eye Movements; Female; Humans; Male; Photic Stimulation; Spain",17/04/2018,2018,17/04/2018,2019-04,23,3,677-688,Closed,Article,"Wilson, C Ellie; Saldaña, David","Wilson, C Ellie (Universidad de Sevilla, Spain); Saldaña, David (Universidad de Sevilla, Spain)","Wilson, C Ellie (University of Seville)","Wilson, C Ellie (University of Seville); Saldaña, David (University of Seville)",University of Seville,grid.9224.d,Spain,,10,5,0.4,2.22,18,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1103522211,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,

Logistic regression was used to obtain crude and adjusted odds ratios for ASD, and by diagnostic subgroup. Seven hundred and ninety-three cases were reported among 66,445 pregnancies. Pregnancy complications and obstetric suboptimality factors were assessed by maternal report of occurrence in first birth and, in secondary analyses, in any birth. Complications and a suboptimality score were significantly associated with having a child with ASD (OR 1.49, 95% CI 1.26, 1.77, P<0.0001 for pregnancy complications in first birth and 2.76, 95% CI 2.04, 3.74, P<0.0001 comparing individuals with four or more obstetric suboptimality factors in first birth to those with none; results similar when assessed in any birth). In particular, gestational diabetes was associated with a significantly increased risk of ASD in results of primary and sensitivity analyses (OR in primary analysis = 1.76, 95% CI 1.34, 2.32, P<0.0001); suboptimal parity and suboptimal age-at-first-birth were also individual factors associated with ASD. Associations were similar by diagnostic subgroup, suggesting autism, Asperger syndrome, and other Pervasive Developmental Disorders are all associated with pregnancy complications. Consistent with previous research, the general class of pregnancy complications was associated with ASD as a whole. Additional work will be required to more fully assess the role of gestational diabetes.","The authors would like to thank the participants of the NHS II, as well as the funding organizations for their support.

Four participant groups were created: high autistic traits, high ADHD traits, high autistic/ADHD traits, and low ADHD/autistic traits. High autistic traits were associated with lower QoL across domains (physical, psychological, social, and environmental). High ADHD traits associated with lower physical, psychological, and environmental QoL. The interaction of autistic and ADHD traits was not significant in any domain. While mental health difficulties were associated with lower QoL, after accounting for mental health, most relationships between autistic traits, ADHD traits and QoL remained.","The authors would like to thank all of the participants who took part in IDEAS and made this research possible.

We aimed to provide more comprehensive insights into white matter alterations of ASD, inclusive of individuals with II (ASD-II-Only) or MV expression (ASD-MV).MethodsSixty-five participants with ASD (ASD-Whole; 16.6 ± 5.9 years; comprising 34 intellectually able youth, ASD-IA, and 31 intellectually impaired youth, ASD-II, including 24 ASD-II-Only plus 7 ASD-MV) and 38 demographic-matched typically developing controls (TDC; 17.3 ± 5.6 years) were scanned in accelerated diffusion-weighted MRI. Fixel-based analysis was undertaken to investigate the categorical differences in fiber density (FD), fiber cross section (FC), and a combined index (FDC), and brain symptom/cognition associations.ResultsASD-Whole had reduced FD in the anterior and posterior corpus callosum and left cerebellum Crus I, and smaller FDC in right cerebellum Crus II, compared to TDC. ASD-IA, relative to TDC, had no significant discrepancies, while ASD-II showed almost identical alterations to those from ASD-Whole vs. TDC. ASD-II-Only had greater FD/FDC in the isthmus splenium of callosum than ASD-MV. Autistic severity negatively correlated with FC in right Crus I. Nonverbal full-scale IQ positively correlated with FC/FDC in cerebellum VI. FD/FDC of the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortex showed a diagnosis-by-executive function interaction.LimitationsWe could not preclude the potential effects of age and sex from the ASD cohort, although statistical tests suggested that these factors were not influential. Our results could be confounded by variable psychiatric comorbidities and psychotropic medication uses in our ASD participants recruited from outpatient clinics, which is nevertheless closer to a real-world presentation of ASD. The outcomes related to ASD-MV were considered preliminaries due to the small sample size within this subgroup. Finally, our study design did not include intellectual impairment-only participants without ASD to disentangle the mixture of autistic and intellectual symptoms.ConclusionsASD-associated white matter alterations appear driven by individuals with II and potentially further by MV. Results suggest that changes in the corpus callosum and cerebellum are key for psychopathology and cognition associated with ASD. Our work highlights an essential to include understudied subpopulations on the spectrum in research.","The authors would like to thank all of our participants and their family members for partaking in this study, Ms. Yi-Chun Liu for carrying out the recruitment and data management, Imaging Center for Integrated Body, Mind and Culture Research, NTU for equipment support, and the anonymous reviewers for comments that significantly improved the manuscript.",Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Brain; Corpus Callosum; Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Humans; White Matter,18/05/2022,2022,18/05/2022,2022-12,13,1,21,All OA; Gold,Article,"Yeh, Chun-Hung; Tseng, Rung-Yu; Ni, Hsing-Chang; Cocchi, Luca; Chang, Jung-Chi; Hsu, Mei-Yun; Tu, En-Nien; Wu, Yu-Yu; Chou, Tai-Li; Gau, Susan Shur-Fen; Lin, Hsiang-Yuan","Yeh, Chun-Hung (Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University, No. 259, Wenhua 1st Road, Guishan District, 333, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan); Tseng, Rung-Yu (Institute for Radiological Research, Chang Gung University, No. 259, Wenhua 1st Road, Guishan District, 333, Taoyuan City, Taiwan; Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan); Ni, Hsing-Chang (Department of Psychiatry, Chang Gung Memorial Hospital at Linkou, Taoyuan, Taiwan); Cocchi, Luca (Clinical Brain Networks Group, QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute, Brisbane, QLD, Australia); Chang, Jung-Chi (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan); Hsu, Mei-Yun (YuNing Clinic, Taipei, Taiwan); Tu, En-Nien (Department of Psychiatry, University of Oxford, Oxford, UK; Department of Psychiatry, Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital, Keelung, Taiwan); Wu, Yu-Yu (YuNing Clinic, Taipei, Taiwan); Chou, Tai-Li (Department of Psychology, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan); Gau, Susan Shur-Fen (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan); Lin, Hsiang-Yuan (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Campbell Family Mental Health Research Institute, and Adult Neurodevelopmental and Geriatric Psychiatry Division, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 1025 Queen St W – 3314, M6J 1H4, Toronto, ON, Canada; Department of Psychiatry and Institute of Medical Science, Temerty Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, ON, Canada)","Yeh, Chun-Hung (Chang Gung University; ); Lin, Hsiang-Yuan (National Taiwan University Hospital; Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; University of Toronto)","Yeh, Chun-Hung (Chang Gung University); Tseng, Rung-Yu (Chang Gung University); Ni, Hsing-Chang (); Cocchi, Luca (QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute); Chang, Jung-Chi (National Taiwan University Hospital); Hsu, Mei-Yun (); Tu, En-Nien (University of Oxford; Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital); Wu, Yu-Yu (); Chou, Tai-Li (National Taiwan University); Gau, Susan Shur-Fen (National Taiwan University Hospital); Lin, Hsiang-Yuan (National Taiwan University Hospital; Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; University of Toronto)",National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University; University of Toronto; Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; QIMR Berghofer Medical Research Institute; Keelung Chang Gung Memorial Hospital; University of Oxford; Chang Gung University,grid.412094.a; grid.19188.39; grid.17063.33; grid.155956.b; grid.1049.c; grid.454209.e; grid.4991.5; grid.145695.a,Taiwan; Taiwan; Canada; Canada; Australia; Taiwan; United Kingdom; Taiwan,Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; Ministry of Science and Technology,1,1,,,3,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-022-00499-1,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1147970051,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,Data Processing Scripts available

The ABAIT was developed with expert consensus and was found to have a suitable fit with RMM.","This research study is supported by the Office of Education Research – National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University (Grant No. OER 18/14 AD).",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child Behavior; Delphi Technique; Female; Humans; Male; Psychometrics; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires,12/01/2019,2019,12/01/2019,2019-05,49,5,1976-1987,Closed,Article,"Dutt, Anuradha; Tan, Marilyn; Alagumalai, Sivakumar; Nair, Rahul","Dutt, Anuradha (Psychological Studies Academic Group, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore, Singapore); Tan, Marilyn (Psychological Studies Academic Group, National Institute of Education, Nanyang Technological University, 1 Nanyang Walk, Singapore, Singapore); Alagumalai, Sivakumar (School of Education, University of Adelaide, Floor/Room – 8/09, Nexus 10 Tower, North Terrace, Adelaide, Australia); Nair, Rahul (Adelaide Dental School, ARCPOH, University of Adelaide, Floor/Room WS9105.14, North Terrace, Adelaide, Australia)","Nair, Rahul (University of Adelaide)","Dutt, Anuradha (Nanyang Technological University); Tan, Marilyn (Nanyang Technological University); Alagumalai, Sivakumar (University of Adelaide); Nair, Rahul (University of Adelaide)",Nanyang Technological University; University of Adelaide,grid.59025.3b; grid.1010.0,Singapore; Australia,,6,2,0.81,2.26,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1111390019,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,

Second-order false belief skills correlated with receptive grammar, vocabulary, and age; sentential complement production predicted second-order false beliefs, controlling for age, receptive grammar and WM. Regressions showed that second-order false belief was associated with age across groups, but with sentential complements in the ASD group only. Second-order false belief skills improved in children who received training in either recursive phrases (d = 0.21) or WM (d = 0.74), compared to an active control group. Results suggest that false belief skills are entwined with both linguistic and executive functions.","Many thanks to children, parents and teachers that participated in the study.

The neglected dimension of external validity,"Systematic reviews have traditionally focused on internal validity, while external validity often has been overlooked. In this study, we systematically reviewed determinants of external validity in the accumulated randomized controlled trials of social skills group interventions for children and adolescents with autism spectrum disorder. We extracted data clustered into six overarching themes: source population, included population, context, treatment provider, treatment intervention, and outcome. A total of 15 eligible randomized controlled trials were identified. The eligible population was typically limited to high-functioning school-aged children with autism spectrum disorder, and the included population was predominantly male and Caucasian. Scant information about the recruitment of participants was provided, and details about treatment providers and settings were sparse. It was not evident from the trials to what extent acquired social skills were enacted in everyday life and maintained over time. We conclude that the generalizability of the accumulated evidence is unclear and that the determinants of external validity are often inadequately reported. At this point, more effectiveness-oriented randomized controlled trials of equally high internal and external validity are needed. More attention to the determinants of external validity is warranted when this new generation of randomized controlled trials are planned and reported. We provide a tentative checklist for this purpose.","The authors would like to thank Viviann Nordin for her contribution to the selection of studies in the systematic literature review, as well as Carl Gornitzki and Klas Moberg for their assistance with the literature search.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Randomized Controlled Trials as Topic; Reproducibility of Results; Social Skills,11/05/2015,2015,11/05/2015,2016-04,20,3,295-305,All OA; Green,Article,"Jonsson, Ulf; Olsson, Nora Choque; Bölte, Sven","Jonsson, Ulf (Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; The National Board of Health and Welfare, Sweden); Olsson, Nora Choque (Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Center for Psychiatry Research, Stockholm County Council, Sweden); Bölte, Sven (Department of Women’s and Children’s Health, Karolinska Institutet, Sweden; Center for Psychiatry Research, Stockholm County Council, Sweden)","Jonsson, Ulf (Karolinska Institute; National Board of Health and Welfare)","Jonsson, Ulf (Karolinska Institute; National Board of Health and Welfare); Olsson, Nora Choque (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council); Bölte, Sven (Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council)",National Board of Health and Welfare; Karolinska Institute; Stockholm Regional Council,grid.416537.2; grid.4714.6; grid.425979.4,Sweden; Sweden; Sweden,,41,10,2.1,10.32,8,http://uu.diva-portal.org/smash/get/diva2:1396987/FULLTEXT01,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1050202392,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3202 Clinical Sciences,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=3780,Systematic Review,

Such heterogeneity may substantially originate from age-differential effects.MethodsVoxel-based morphometry was applied in 86 males with ASD and 90 typically developing control (TDC) males (aged 7 to 29 years). Three steps of statistical modeling (model 1, multiple regression with age as a covariate; model 2, multiple regression further considering diagnosis-by-age interaction; model 3, age-stratified analyses) were performed to dissect the moderating effects of age on diagnostic group differences in neuroanatomy.ResultsAcross ages, males with and without ASD did not differ significantly in total gray matter (GM) or white matter (WM) volumes. For both groups, total GM volumes decreased and WM volumes increased with age. For regional volume, comparing with the model only held the age constant (model 1), the main effect of group altered when diagnosis-by-age interaction effects were considered (model 2). Here, participants with ASD had significantly greater relative regional GM volumes than TDC in the right inferior orbitofrontal cortex and bilateral thalamus; for WM, participants with ASD were larger than TDC in the bilateral splenium of corpus callosum and right anterior corona radiata. Importantly, significant diagnosis-by-age interactions were identified at the bilateral anterior prefrontal cortex, bilateral cuneus, bilateral caudate, and the left cerebellum Crus I for GM and left forceps minor for WM. Finally, age-stratified analyses (model 3) showed distinct patterns in GM and WM volumetric alterations in ASD among subsamples of children, adolescents, and adults.ConclusionsOur findings suggest that the heterogeneous reports on the atypical neuroanatomy of ASD may substantially originate from age variation in the study samples. Age variation and its methodological and biological implications have to be carefully delineated in future studies of the neurobiology of ASD.","This work was supported by grants from National Science Council of Taiwan (NSC97-3112-B-002-009, NSC98-3112-B-002-004, NSC 99-2627-B-002-015, NSC 100-2627-B-002-014, NSC 101-2627-B-002-002, NSC 101-2314-B-002-136-MY3), National Taiwan University (AIM for Top University Excellent Research Project: 10R81918-03, 101R892103, 102R892103), National Taiwan University Hospital (NTUH101-S1910, NTUH103-N2574, NTUH104-S2761) and in part by the Department of Medical Imaging and 3 T MRI Lab in National Taiwan University Hospital.

In 94 college students, Autism Spectrum Quotient (AQ) and psychoacoustic abilities were measured. Results indicated that higher AQ, higher rapid auditory processing (RAP), and maleness were associated with a lower APR accuracy for low-intensity prosodies. There was a strong positive association between RAP and APR for participants with high AQ, whereas low-AQ participants showed no such pattern.

Social skills programmes, such as LEGO® based therapy (LBT), are commonly used to help with these difficulties. The aim of this study was to examine the acceptability of LBT using qualitative interviews and questionnaires with facilitators and parents/guardians on behalf of autistic children and young people. Acceptability was measured in line with constructs of the Theoretical Framework of Acceptability. Questionnaires were analyzed descriptively and between group comparisons were undertaken using the Mann-Whitney U Test. Telephone interviews were undertaken with a sub-sample of facilitators. All interviews were recorded, transcribed verbatim, and framework analysis was performed by two researchers supported by NVivo. The questionnaire response rate was 80% for facilitators and 77% for parents/guardians. Overall acceptability, measured on a 1-5 (minimum-maximum) scale, was high for both facilitators and parents/guardians with a median (range) of 5 (4-5) and 4 (3-5), respectively. Facilitators rated the acceptability of the programme significantly higher overall than parents (p < 0.001). Facilitators reported that participants and wider school staff viewed the programme positively. They observed improvements in communication and social skills during the sessions. Potential barriers to programme delivery, such as resources and staff schedules, were identified but facilitators reported that these challenges did not outweigh the benefits. There is increasing emphasis on the role of schools in seeking to improve social outcomes for autistic children therefore this high degree of acceptability makes this an attractive school-based programme for schools, autistic children and their families. LAY SUMMARY: Social skills programmes, such as LEGO® based therapy (LBT), are often used to help autistic children and young people with their social skills. The acceptability of LBT with school staff and parents/guardians on behalf of children and young people was explored using interviews and questionnaires. Our results show that LBT is viewed as a highly acceptable programme that can help autistic children and young people improve their communication and social skills.","We would like to thank all of the families and schools that participated in the study.

442,999,pub.1141149644,10.1002/aur.2610,34529351,,,Factors associated with age at autism diagnosis in a community sample of Australian adults,"Autism diagnosis in adulthood has become increasingly common due to a range of factors including changes in awareness, diagnostic criteria, and professional practices. Past research identified a range of demographic and autism-related factors associated with autism diagnosis age in children. However, it is unclear whether these apply to autistic adults. This study aimed to examine predictors of autism diagnosis age in adults while controlling for current age and autistic traits. We used a cross-sectional sample of 657 adults aged 15-80 from three self and carer-report studies: the Australian Longitudinal Study of Autism in Adulthood (ALSAA), Study of Australian School-Leavers with Autism (SASLA) and Pathways, Predictors and Impact of Receiving an Autism Spectrum Diagnosis in Adulthood (Pathways). Using hierarchical multiplicative heteroscedastic regression, we found that older current age and higher self-reported autistic traits predicted older diagnosis age, and that female gender, lack of intellectual disability, language other than English, family history of autism, lifetime depression, and no obsessive-compulsive disorder predicted older diagnosis age beyond current age and autistic traits. The paradoxical relationship between high autistic traits and older diagnosis age requires further investigation. Based on these findings, we recommended strategies to improve autism recognition in women and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds. Future studies could extend the findings by examining the effects of childhood and adulthood socioeconomic status on adult diagnosis age. LAY SUMMARY: We studied the relationship between age at autism diagnosis and other characteristics in adults. We found that both older current age and higher autistic traits, female gender, language other than English, family history of autism, and history of depression were related to older age at diagnosis, while intellectual disability and history of obsessive-compulsive disorder were related to younger age at diagnosis. Our findings suggest more work is needed to help recognize autism in women and people from non-English-speaking backgrounds.","This work was supported by the Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), established and supported under the Australian Government&#x27;s Cooperative Research Centres Program.

This study used administrative data from Ontario, Canada, to compare the health of reproductive-aged autistic women with non-autistic women. Overall, reproductive-aged autistic women had poorer health compared with non-autistic women, including increased rates of material deprivation, chronic medical conditions, psychiatric conditions, history of assault, and use of potentially teratogenic medications (i.e. drugs that can be harmful to the development of an embryo or fetus). These findings suggest that there is a need for health interventions tailored to the needs of reproductive-aged autistic women.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Chronic Disease; Cross-Sectional Studies; Female; Humans; Ontario,19/01/2021,2021,19/01/2021,2021-05,25,4,1114-1124,All OA; Green,Article,"Tint, Ami; Brown, Hilary K; Chen, Simon; Lai, Meng-Chuan; Tarasoff, Lesley A; Vigod, Simone N; Parish, Susan; Havercamp, Susan M; Lunsky, Yona","Tint, Ami (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Canada); Brown, Hilary K (University of Toronto Scarborough, Canada; University of Toronto, Canada; ICES, Canada; Women’s College Hospital and Research Institute, Canada); Chen, Simon (ICES, Canada); Lai, Meng-Chuan (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Canada; University of Toronto, Canada; The Hospital for Sick Children, Canada; University of Cambridge, UK; National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taiwan); Tarasoff, Lesley A (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Canada; University of Toronto Scarborough, Canada); Vigod, Simone N (University of Toronto, Canada; ICES, Canada; Women’s College Hospital and Research Institute, Canada); Parish, Susan (Virginia Commonwealth University, USA); Havercamp, Susan M (The Ohio State University, USA); Lunsky, Yona (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Canada; University of Toronto, Canada; ICES, Canada)","Lunsky, Yona (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; University of Toronto; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences)","Tint, Ami (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health); Brown, Hilary K (University of Toronto; University of Toronto; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences; Women's College Hospital); Chen, Simon (Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences); Lai, Meng-Chuan (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; University of Toronto; Hospital for Sick Children; University of Cambridge; National Taiwan University Hospital); Tarasoff, Lesley A (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; University of Toronto); Vigod, Simone N (University of Toronto; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences; Women's College Hospital); Parish, Susan (Virginia Commonwealth University); Havercamp, Susan M (The Ohio State University); Lunsky, Yona (Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; University of Toronto; Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences)",Institute for Clinical Evaluative Sciences; University of Toronto; Centre for Addiction and Mental Health; University of Cambridge; Women's College Hospital; National Taiwan University Hospital; Hospital for Sick Children; Virginia Commonwealth University; The Ohio State University,grid.418647.8; grid.17063.33; grid.155956.b; grid.5335.0; grid.417199.3; grid.412094.a; grid.42327.30; grid.224260.0; grid.261331.4,Canada; Canada; Canada; United Kingdom; Canada; Taiwan; Canada; United States; United States,Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,4,4,,,23,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8089036,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134713639,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3215 Reproductive Medicine,3 Good Health and Well Being,No,,,

Previous studies have provided behavioral evidence of atypical auditory processing towards IDS in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), while the underlying neurophysiological mechanisms remain unknown. This event-related potential (ERP) study investigated the neural coding of formant-exaggerated speech and nonspeech in 24 4- to 11-year-old children with ASD and 24 typically-developing (TD) peers. The EEG data were recorded using an alternating block design, in which each stimulus type (exaggerated/non-exaggerated sound) was presented with equal probability. ERP waveform analysis revealed an enhanced P1 for vowel formant exaggeration in the TD group but not in the ASD group. This speech-specific atypical processing in ASD was not found for the nonspeech stimuli which showed similar P1 enhancement in both ASD and TD groups. Moreover, the time-frequency analysis indicated that children with ASD showed differences in neural synchronization in the delta-theta bands for processing acoustic formant changes embedded in nonspeech. Collectively, the results add substantiating neurophysiological evidence (i.e., a lack of neural enhancement effect of vowel exaggeration) for atypical auditory processing of IDS in children with ASD, which may exert a negative effect on phonetic encoding and language learning. LAY SUMMARY: Atypical responses to motherese might act as a potential early marker of risk for children with ASD. This study investigated the neural responses to such socially relevant stimuli in the ASD brain, and the results suggested a lack of neural enhancement responding to the motherese even in individuals without intellectual disability.",Grant sponsor: Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) overseas collaboration grant; Grant number: 31728009.

The Study to Explore Early Development (SEED) is a multisite case-control study of children aged 30-69 months, born in 2003-2006. Cases are children previously diagnosed and newly identified with ASD enrolled from education and clinical settings. Children with a previously diagnosed non-ASD developmental condition were included in the developmental delay/disorder (DD) control group. The population (POP) control group included children randomly sampled from birth certificates. Clinical illness from infection during the first 28 days (""neonatal,"" from medical records) and first three years of life (caregiver report) in cases was compared to DD and POP controls; and between cases with and without regression. Children with ASD had greater odds of neonatal (OR = 1.8; 95%CI: 1.1, 2.9) and early childhood infection (OR = 1.7; 95%CI: 1.5, 1.9) compared to POP children, and greater odds of neonatal infection (OR = 1.5; 95%CI: 1.1, 2.0) compared to DD children. Cases with regression had 1.6 times the odds (95%CI: 1.1, 2.3) of caregiver-reported infection during the first year of life compared to cases without regression, but neonatal infection risk and overall early childhood infection risk did not differ. Our results support the hypothesis that children with ASD are more likely to have infection early in life compared to the general population and to children with other developmental conditions. Future studies should examine the contributions of different causes, timing, frequency, and severity of infection to ASD risk. Autism Research 2019, 12: 136-146. © 2018 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: We looked at infections during early childhood in relation to autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found that children with ASD were more likely to have an infection in the first 28 days of life and before age three compared to children with typical development. Children with ASD were also more likely than children with other developmental delays or disorders to have an infection in the first 28 days of life.","This research was supported by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Centers for Autism and Developmental Disabilities Research, Study to Explore Early Development through six cooperative agreements: Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000180, Colorado School of Public Health/University of Colorado, School of Medicine; Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000181, Kaiser Foundation Research Institute (CA); Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000182, University of Pennsylvania; Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000183, Johns Hopkins University; Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000184, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill; and Cooperative Agreement Number U10DD000498, Michigan State University.

This study explored sex differences in play complexity and toy engagement within caregiver-child interaction samples for preschool-aged children (2-5 years 11 months) with an autism spectrum disorder who were matched to typically developing children on sex and non-verbal development. Overall we found that girls and boys with autism spectrum disorder were largely equivalent in their play complexity. Despite similar play, girls and boys with autism spectrum disorder differed in a number of ways in their toy engagement, replicating traditional gender differences-girls played more with dolls and domestic items (though at lower rates than typically developing girls) and boys played more with the garage and cars (though at lower rates than typically developing boys). Our findings support the importance and utility of examining sex differences in autism spectrum disorder in light of those observed within typical development.","The authors thank the PACT Consortium members for their valuable feedback and Faye Plummer for her assistance with coding.

Prevalence rates are variable, and have been attributed to age, gender, comorbidity, subtype of pervasive developmental disorder (PDD) and risk factors. Recent studies have suggested disparate clinical and genetic settings depending on simplex or multiplex autism. The aim of this study was to assess: 1) the prevalence of epilepsy in multiplex autism and its association with genetic and non-genetic risk factors of major effect, intellectual disability and gender; and 2) whether autism and epilepsy cosegregate within multiplex autism families.MethodsWe extracted from the Autism Genetic Resource Exchange (AGRE) database (n = 3,818 children from 1,264 families) all families with relevant medical data (n = 664 children from 290 families). The sample included 478 children with ASD and 186 siblings without ASD. We analyzed the following variables: seizures, genetic and non-genetic risk factors, gender, and cognitive functioning as assessed by Raven’s Colored Progressive Matrices (RCPM) and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales (VABS).ResultsThe prevalence of epilepsy was 12.8% in cases with ASD and 2.2% in siblings without ASD (P <10-5). With each RCPM or VABS measure, the risk of epilepsy in multiplex autism was significantly associated with intellectual disability, but not with gender. Identified risk factors (genetic or non-genetic) of autism tended to be significantly associated with epilepsy (P = 0.052). When children with prematurity, pre- or perinatal insult, or cerebral palsy were excluded, a genetic risk factor was reported for 6/59 (10.2%) of children with epilepsy and 12/395 (3.0%) of children without epilepsy (P = 0.002). Finally, using a permutation test, there was significant evidence that the epilepsy phenotype co-segregated within families (P <10-4).ConclusionsEpilepsy in multiplex autism may define a different subgroup in terms of clinical characteristics and genetic risk.","We gratefully acknowledge the resources provided by the AGRE Consortium and the participating AGRE families.

We examined inter-state variation in VR service use and outcomes among TAY-ASD in 2014–2016, finding significant differences in the percentage of TAY-ASD who received VR services, entered VR services during secondary school, had timely development of an employment plan, and were employed at VR exit. Inter-state differences remained significant after adjusting for the influence of individual-level demographics and state-level unemployment and fiscal capacity, suggesting other factors influence variation. Future research should monitor whether changes in the VR program, via the 2014 Workforce Innovation and Opportunity Act, move the needle on VR outcomes for TAY-ASD.","This project was supported by the Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) of the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) under UJ2MC31073: Maternal and Child Health-Autism Transitions Research Project.

A One Year Follow-up of Autistic, Attention and Anxiety Symptoms in High-Functioning Children with Autism Spectrum Disorder","Gender differences in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) symptoms and associated problem behaviours over development may provide clues regarding why more males than females are diagnosed with ASD. Fifty-six high-functioning children with ASD, and 44 typically developing controls, half of the participants female, were assessed at baseline (aged 7–12 years) and one-year later, collecting measures of autism, attention and anxiety symptoms, school placement and support information. Findings indicated no gender differences in autistic symptoms. Males were more hyperactive and received more integration-aide support in mainstream schools, and females were more socially anxious. Overall, similar gender profiles were present across two time points. Lower hyperactivity levels in females might contribute to their under-identification.

It is characterized by social communication deficits and repetitive behaviors/restricted interests. In the absence of any medications known to improve core symptom domains, parents often use complementary alternative treatments, including omega-3 fatty acid supplements.MethodsWe conducted a 6-month, randomized, placebo controlled trial of omega-3 fatty acid supplements (1.5 g) vs placebo in children 2 to 5 years of age with ASD. Primary outcome measures included the autism composite score of the Pervasive Developmental Disorders Behavioral Inventory (PDDBI) and the externalizing problems score of the Behavior Assessment System for Children (BASC-2). Secondary outcome measures included clinical global improvement (Clinical Global Impression-Improvement (CGI-I)), adaptive function (Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scale (VABS-II)), and language gains (Preschool Language Scale (PLS-4)), as well as safety. Exploratory analysis investigated potential correlations between changes in cytokine profiles and treatment response.ResultsThirty-eight participants were randomized in a 1:1 fashion. There was no significant difference between groups on the 0- to 24-week change in PDDBI autism composite scores (p = 0.5). There was a significant group by week interaction on the BASC-2 externalizing problem score, with participants randomized to the treatment group demonstrating worsening scores (p = 0.02). There was no statistically significant week by group effect on either adaptive function (p = 0.09) or language (p = 0.6). Omega-3s were relatively well tolerated. Changes in cytokines during the study did not significantly correlate with treatment response.ConclusionsThis study does not support high dose supplementation of omega-3 fatty acids in young children with ASD.Trial registrationClinicaltrials.gov NCT01248728.

It remains unclear whether and how neural sex/gender differences are related to behavioural sex/gender differences in autism. Here, we examined whether atypical neural responses during mentalizing and self-representation are sex/gender-dependent in autistic adults and explored whether 'camouflaging' (acting as if behaviourally neurotypical) is associated with sex/gender-dependent neural responses. In total, N = 119 adults (33 typically developing males, 29 autistic males, 29 typically developing females and 28 autistic females) participated in a task-related functional magnetic resonance imaging paradigm to assess neural activation within right temporo-parietal junction and ventromedial prefrontal cortex during mentalizing and self-representation. Camouflaging in autism was quantified as the discrepancy between extrinsic behaviour in social-interpersonal contexts and intrinsic status. While autistic men showed hypoactive right temporo-parietal junction mentalizing and ventromedial prefrontal cortex self-representation responses compared to typically developing men, such neural responses in autistic women were not different from typically developing women. In autistic women only, increasing camouflaging was associated with heightened ventromedial prefrontal cortex self-representation response. There is a lack of impaired neural self-representation and mentalizing in autistic women compared to typically developing women. Camouflaging is heightened in autistic women and may relate to neural self-representation response. These results reveal brain-behaviour relations that help explain sex/gender-heterogeneity in social brain function in autism.","Part of this work was presented as a poster in the 11th Annual International Meeting for Autism Research (IMFAR) during 17–19 May 2012, Toronto, ON, Canada.

This is due to their increased barriers to dental care services, self-harm behaviors and dietary habits that may favor tooth decay. In this review, we summarized the current evidence comparing the oral health status of children and adolescents diagnosed with and without ASD. After a systematic search in the literature, we found that the salivary pH of individuals diagnosed with ASD was significantly lower, but the results were not clinically significant that can increase their risks to tooth decay. We also found weak evidence suggesting a higher percentage of children and adolescents diagnosed with ASD having the habit of tooth grinding compared with their neurotypical counterparts. When comparing salivary flow rate, tooth decay, gum diseases, tooth malalignment and tooth trauma; no significant differences were found between the two groups. The findings did not suggest ASD as a predisposing factor to oral diseases: other factors including sugary diet and inadequate oral hygiene may play a more important role. We also call for further research to establish more concrete association between ASD and oral diseases.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Child; Feeding Behavior; Humans; Mouth Diseases; Oral Health,13/01/2020,2020,13/01/2020,2020-07,24,5,1047-1066,Closed,Article,"Lam, Phoebe PY; Du, Rennan; Peng, Simin; McGrath, Colman PJ; Yiu, Cynthia KY","Lam, Phoebe PY (The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Du, Rennan (The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Peng, Simin (The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong); McGrath, Colman PJ (The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong); Yiu, Cynthia KY (The University of Hong Kong, Hong Kong)","Yiu, Cynthia KY (University of Hong Kong)","Lam, Phoebe PY (University of Hong Kong); Du, Rennan (University of Hong Kong); Peng, Simin (University of Hong Kong); McGrath, Colman PJ (University of Hong Kong); Yiu, Cynthia KY (University of Hong Kong)",University of Hong Kong,grid.194645.b,China,,36,29,9.77,28.56,14,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1124074951,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 3203 Dentistry,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=96508,Systematic Review,

Autistic individuals reportedly experience difficulties in both retrieving episodic memories and monitoring their accuracy, which has important implications for eyewitness testimony. Thirty autistic and 33 IQ-matched typically developing (TD) participants viewed a video of a mock bank robbery followed by three phases of questions (with judgments of confidence). In Phase 1, participants freely generated the granularity of their responses (i.e., fine- or coarse-grained). In Phase 2, participants answered the same questions but provided both a fine- and a coarse-grained answer. In Phase 3, participants were instructed to maximize accuracy over informativeness by selecting one of their Phase 2 answers as their final answer. They either received the questions socially (from the experimenter) or answered them online. There were no group differences in accuracy or metacognitive monitoring, with both autistic and TD witnesses demonstrating: (a) a strong preference for reporting fine-grained details at the expense of accuracy; (b) improved though still suboptimal grain size reporting when instructed to maximize accuracy over informativeness; (c) effective accuracy monitoring; and (d) higher overall accuracy when questions were delivered socially. There was, however, a subtle difference in metacognitive control, with autistic witnesses performing more poorly than TD witnesses when questions were delivered socially, but not when they were delivered online. These findings contrast with evidence suggesting that autism is marked by impairments in episodic memory and metacognitive monitoring and control. Autism Res 2020, 13: 2017-2029. © 2020 The Authors.

Associations between motor skill and social communication skills have been reported in both typical development (TD) and autism spectrum disorder (ASD). The current study extends these findings to characterize performance on a fine motor imitation task, probing skills as a predictor of social and communicative functioning, and co-speech gesture use. These research questions were addressed by a secondary analysis of data collected during a previous study characterizing a cohort of individuals who were diagnosed with ASD in early childhood but lost the autism diagnosis (LAD) by the time of adolescence. Fine motor imitation skills were compared between 14 individuals with LAD, 15 individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), and 12 typically developing (TD) individuals. LAD and TD groups had more advanced fine motor imitation skills than the ASD group, and abilities were significantly associated with ASD symptoms and amount of gesture use (though there was a counterintuitive interaction between group and fine motor skill in the LAD and TD groups only, in which lower motor skills predicted more ASD symptoms; this relationship was of a small effect size and is likely driven by the compressed range of fine motor skills in these two groups). Findings suggest that fine motor skills normalize along with social communication skills and restricted and repetitive behaviors and interests in individuals who lose the ASD diagnosis, and that individuals with better fine motor abilities produce more co-speech gesture.",This research was funded by NIMH-1R01MH112687-01A1 to Eigsti and Fein (Co-PIs).,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,01/07/2021,2021,01/07/2021,2021-08,86,,101824,All OA; Green,Article,"Taverna, Elise C; Huedo-Medina, Tania B; Fein, Deborah A; Eigsti, Inge-Marie","Taverna, Elise C (University of Connecticut Department of Psychological Sciences, 406 Babbidge Road, Unit 1020, Storrs, CT 06260, United States.); Huedo-Medina, Tania B (University of Connecticut Department of Psychological Sciences, 406 Babbidge Road, Unit 1020, Storrs, CT 06260, United States.); Fein, Deborah A (University of Connecticut Department of Psychological Sciences, 406 Babbidge Road, Unit 1020, Storrs, CT 06260, United States.); Eigsti, Inge-Marie (University of Connecticut Department of Psychological Sciences, 406 Babbidge Road, Unit 1020, Storrs, CT 06260, United States.)","Eigsti, Inge-Marie (University of Connecticut)","Taverna, Elise C (University of Connecticut); Huedo-Medina, Tania B (University of Connecticut); Fein, Deborah A (University of Connecticut); Eigsti, Inge-Marie (University of Connecticut)",University of Connecticut,grid.63054.34,United States,National Institute of Mental Health,5,5,,,3,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8294070,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1139308878,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,Pre-registration of a follow up study https://osf.io/uewmp/?view_only=a6dc8fee70e94115b6154114effb42b9

Previous evidence indicates that individuals with autism and schizophrenia are more likely to integrate multisensory inputs over a longer temporal binding window (TBW). However, whether such deficits in audiovisual temporal integration extend to subclinical populations with high schizotypal and autistic traits are unclear. Using audiovisual simultaneity judgment (SJ) tasks for nonspeech and speech stimuli, our results suggested that the width of the audiovisual TBW was not significantly correlated with self-reported schizotypal and autistic traits in a group of young adults. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) resting-state activity was also acquired to explore the neural correlates underlying inter-individual variability of TBW width. Across the entire sample, stronger resting-state functional connectivity (rsFC) between the left superior temporal cortex and the left precuneus, and weaker rsFC between the left cerebellum and the right dorsal lateral prefrontal cortex were correlated with a narrower TBW for speech stimuli. Meanwhile, stronger rsFC between the left anterior superior temporal gyrus and the right inferior temporal gyrus was correlated with a wider audiovisual TBW for non-speech stimuli. The TBW-related rsFC was not affected by levels of subclinical traits. In conclusion, this study indicates that audiovisual temporal processing may not be affected by autistic and schizotypal traits and rsFC between brain regions responding to multisensory information and timing may account for the inter-individual difference in TBW width. LAY SUMMARY: Individuals with ASD and schizophrenia are more likely to perceive asynchronous auditory and visual events as occurring simultaneously even if they are well separated in time. We investigated whether similar difficulties in audiovisual temporal processing were present in subclinical populations with high autistic and schizotypal traits. We found that the ability to detect audiovisual asynchrony was not affected by different levels of autistic and schizotypal traits. We also found that connectivity of some brain regions engaging in multisensory and timing tasks might explain an individual's tendency to bind multisensory information within a wide or narrow time window.

464,966,pub.1136654250,10.1002/aur.2504,33764656,,,Age differences in broader autism phenotype traits from young adulthood to older adulthood,"Much of past research has been dedicated to refining the operationalization and correlates of the broader autism phenotype (BAP) and less on how the BAP differs by socio-demographic characteristics, like age-particularly after midlife. This gap is important because other nonclinical trait-like characteristics (e.g., personality) have shown considerable age differences, leading to work assessing the malleability of psychological characteristics and improving outcomes for individuals and their significant others. In the current study, we examined cross-sectional age differences in the BAP in a large sample of adults ranging in age from 18 to 85. We recruited a sample of 2966 adults ranging in age from 18 to 85 (Mage = 36.53, SD = 12.61; 58.9% Female; 1.1% with an ASD diagnosis) recruited from an online survey service. We found that total BAP scores were higher in younger adults and lower among older adults. These differences were particularly true for pragmatic language difficulties, with this component of the BAP showing the most dramatic age differences. Aloofness showed similar negative associations with age, albeit much smaller. Rigidity was not significantly associated with age. The results are consistent with other research showing an abatement of symptoms among individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASDs) across early life and theories predicting changes in other psychological characteristics (e.g., personality). The results are discussed in the context of the malleability of ASD and BAP traits across life, the clinical implications of these changes, and the origins and consequences for lifespan differences in BAP. LAY SUMMARY: Little is known about how subclinical autistic-like traits among middle-aged and older adults compare to younger adults. We found that these subclinical traits were highest in young adults and lowest in older adults. Knowing how these traits differ by age can provide researchers and clinicians with a sense of how much these traits might change across life, if the traits might be sensitive to interventions, and when in development it might be best to intervene.",This research was supported by grants from Templeton Foundation&#x27;s Pathways to Character Initiative.

The present study addresses this knowledge gap by examining the relationship between functional brain connectivity and Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule (ADOS) scores using publicly available data from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE) database (N = 107). This relationship was tested across all brain voxels, without a priori assumptions, using a novel statistical approach. ADOS scores were primarily associated with decreased connectivity to right temporoparietal junction, right anterior insula, and left fusiform gyrus (p < 0.05, corrected). Seven large-scale brain networks influenced these associations. Findings largely encompassed brain regions involved in processing socially relevant information, highlighting the importance of these processes in autism spectrum disorder.","This work was supported by National Institutes of Health grants R01MH102224 (JRT), R01DK103691 (JRT), R21DK102052 (JRT), K01DK100445 (KTL), and UL1TR002535 (KTL/KW).",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; Cerebral Cortex; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Neural Pathways; Neuroimaging; Temporal Lobe,31/01/2020,2020,31/01/2020,2020-08,50,8,2765-2778,All OA; Green,Article,"Wylie, Korey P.; Tregellas, Jason R.; Bear, Joshua J.; Legget, Kristina T.","Wylie, Korey P.

Previous investigations of this heterogeneity have ordinarily used questionnaires and have rarely investigated sensory processing in typical development (TD) alongside autism spectrum development (ASD).MethodsThe present study used hierarchical clustering in a large sample to identify subgroups of young autistic and typically developing children based on the normalized global field power (GFP) of their event-related potentials (ERPs) to auditory stimuli of four different loudness intensities (50, 60, 70, 80 dB SPL): that is, based on an index of the relative strengths of their neural responses across these loudness conditions.ResultsFour clusters of participants were defined. Normalized GFP responses to sounds of different intensities differed strongly across clusters. There was considerable overlap in cluster assignments of autistic and typically developing participants, but autistic participants were more likely to display a pattern of relatively linear increases in response strength accompanied by a disproportionately strong response to 70 dB stimuli. Autistic participants displaying this pattern trended towards obtaining higher scores on assessments of cognitive abilities. There was also a trend for typically developing participants to disproportionately fall into a cluster characterized by disproportionately/nonlinearly strong 60 dB responses. Greater auditory distractibility was reported among autistic participants in a cluster characterized by disproportionately strong responses to the loudest (80 dB) sounds, and furthermore, relatively strong responses to loud sounds were correlated with auditory distractibility. This appears to provide evidence of coinciding behavioral and neural sensory atypicalities.LimitationsReplication may be needed to verify exploratory results. This analysis does not address variability related to classical ERP latencies and topographies. The sensory questionnaire employed was not specifically designed for use in autism. Hearing acuity was not measured. Variability in sensory responses unrelated to loudness is not addressed, leaving room for additional research.ConclusionsTaken together, these data demonstrate the broader benefits of using electrophysiology to explore individual differences. They illuminate different neural response patterns and suggest relationships between sensory neural responses and sensory behaviors, cognitive abilities, and autism diagnostic status.","We wish to gratefully acknowledge all of the children and families who generously devoted considerable time and effort to participate in this large study, which included many other components besides ERP data collection.

Central sensitivity syndromes (CSS) are a group of related conditions that are thought to include an underlying sensitisation of the central nervous system; heightened sensory sensitivity is a common feature. Anecdotal evidence suggests autistic adults may be more prone to developing a CSS. This study aimed to investigate the occurrence of CSS diagnoses and symptoms in autistic adults, and to explore whether CSS symptoms were related to autistic traits, mental health, sensory sensitivity, or gender.MethodsThe full sample of participants included 973 autistic adults (410 men, 563 women, mean age = 44.6) registered at the Netherlands Autism Register, who completed questionnaires assessing autistic traits, sensory sensitivity, CSS, physical and mental health symptoms. The reliability and validity of the Central Sensitization Inventory (CSI) in an autistic sample was established using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Chi2 analyses, independent t-tests, hierarchical regression and path analysis were used to analyse relationships between CSS symptoms, autistic traits, measures of mental health and wellbeing, sensory sensitivity, age and gender.Results21% of participants reported one or more CSS diagnosis, and 60% scored at or above the clinical cut-off for a CSS. Autistic women were more likely to report a CSS diagnosis and experienced more CSS symptoms than men. Sensory sensitivity, anxiety, age and gender were significant predictors of CSS symptoms, with sensory sensitivity and anxiety fully mediating the relationship between autistic traits and CSS symptoms.LimitationsAlthough this study included a large sample of autistic adults, we did not have a control group or a CSS only group. We also could not include a non-binary group due to lack of statistical power.ConclusionsCSS diagnoses and symptoms appear to be very common in the autistic population. Increased awareness of an association between autism and central sensitisation should inform clinicians and guide diagnostic practice, particularly for women where CSS are common and autism under recognised.",We would like to thank the participants of the Netherlands Autism Register for their contribution to this study.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Adult; Autistic Disorder; Female; Humans; Male; Netherlands; Reproducibility of Results; Surveys and Questionnaires; Syndrome,14/02/2022,2022,14/02/2022,2022-12,13,1,7,All OA; Gold,Article,"Grant, Sarah; Norton, Sam; Weiland, Ricarda F.; Scheeren, Anke M.; Begeer, Sander; Hoekstra, Rosa A.","Grant, Sarah (Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London, SE5 8AF, London, UK); Norton, Sam (Department of Psychology, Institute of Psychiatry, Psychology and Neuroscience, King’s College London, SE5 8AF, London, UK); Weiland, Ricarda F.

A community survey about early autism studies,"Engagement with stakeholders is an essential part of the research process. This is particularly the case for early autism research with infant cohorts and their families, where a range of ethical issues are pertinent. Here, we report on a large survey of parents who have a child on the autism spectrum (n = 1040) which specifically probed attitudes to early autism research. The large majority of parents showed positive attitudes overall, and these were associated with greater access to services, higher service quality ratings and higher rates of intellectual disability among their children. Parents valued the scientific goals of research, but half of parents also reported that an intervention component would be an essential prerequisite for them to participate in research. If enrolled in a study, parents were positive about most commonly used measures though less favourably disposed towards brain scans for children. They valued direct contact with the research team and openness in data sharing. We interpret our findings in terms of lessons for the early autism research community and for stakeholder engagement projects.","This research would not have been possible without the contribution of hundreds of parents, who we thank for taking part.

474,944,pub.1117860174,10.1002/aur.2169,31287626,,,Reduced structural brain asymmetry during neonatal life is potentially related to autism spectrum disorders in children born extremely preterm,"Disruption of the normal patterns of structural brain asymmetry, and in language-related areas, has been reported in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We tested the hypothesis that 16 children born extremely preterm (EPT), and diagnosed with ASD at 6.5 years of age (EPT-ASD), would have different patterns of brain structural asymmetry, particularly in language-related areas, to 21 EPT children without ASD and 15 term-born children. They all underwent neonatal magnetic resonance imaging scans at 40 weeks of gestation. ASD diagnoses and the Weschler Intelligence Scale for Children-Fourth Edition, were performed in the EPT children, but not in the term group. Asymmetry indices (AIs) were assessed at three levels: global (hemispheres), lobar (brain lobes), and modular (primary sensorimotor, unimodal, and higher-order association areas). AIs were also assessed in language-related regions and correlational analyses were performed between these AIs and verbal scores. The EPT-ASD group showed reduced structural asymmetry at the modular level, mainly involving the higher-order association cortices and the language-related areas. Predominant positive correlations between language functioning and leftward AIs in the inferior frontal gyrus (opercular) and supplementary cortices, and rightward asymmetry in the angular and supramarginal gyri, were identified in the EPT-ASD group. The overall results suggest that reduced brain structural asymmetry identified during the neonatal period would be a risk factor for the development of ASD in EPT infants. This finding could identify EPT children at risk at an early stage, so that tailored interventions could be used to optimize their functions and quality of life. Autism Res 2019, 12: 1334-1343. © 2019 International Society for Autism Research, Wiley Periodicals, Inc. LAY SUMMARY: Babies born before the expected date (preterm) are more likely to develop autism, due to abnormal brain development. Compared with children without autism, preterm children with autism did not display the important physical differences between the two sides of their brain that are needed for normal functioning. As this alteration was found just after birth, this information could be used to identify children who are likely to develop autism, so that they can get medical support at an earlier age.","The authors would like to thank all the participating children and their parents.

The features are often difficult to capture in structured laboratory settings, and the results from tests do not necessarily reflect symptom severity. We investigated neurophysiological processing in the passive parts of a cued Go-NoGo task, using the active parts of the test as a comparator.MethodsForty-nine adolescents diagnosed with ASD and 49 typically developing (TD) adolescents (age 12–21 years) were included. Daily life executive function was assessed with the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function (BRIEF). We applied a visual cued Go-NoGo task and recorded event-related potentials (ERPs). We investigated occipital N1, a component related to early perception of visual stimuli, and P3a, a fronto-central component related to switching of attention, in the passive and active parts of the test.ResultsDuring the passive parts, the ASD group had statistically significantly longer N1 latency (p < 0.001, Cohens d = 0.75) and enhanced amplitude of P3a (p = 0.002, Cohens d = 0.64) compared to the TD, while no significant differences were observed in the active parts. Both components correlated significantly with the Behavioral Regulation Index of the BRIEF (partial correlation r = 0.35, p = 0.003).ConclusionDelayed N1 response, indicating altered visual perception, and enhanced P3a response, indicating increased neural activation related to attention allocation, were found during the passive parts of a Go-NoGo task in ASD participants. These abnormal ERP signals in the non-structured settings were associated with everyday executive function, suggesting that neurophysiolocal measures related to atypical control of alertness and “hyper-awareness” underlie daily life dysfunction in ASD. Assessments during passive settings have a potential to reveal core neurobiological substrates of ASD.","The authors thank all the participants and their parents for providing the necessary information.

Growing evidence suggests that cognitive behaviour therapies and mindfulness-based therapies can help autistic individuals learn to manage feelings of anxiety but access to such therapies remains problematic. In the current pilot study, we examined whether existing online cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy self-help tools can help reduce anxiety in autistic adults. Specifically, 35 autistic adults were asked to try either an existing online cognitive behaviour therapy (n = 16) or mindfulness-based therapy (n = 19) programme while a further 19 autistic adults served as a waitlist comparison group. A first important finding was that 23 of the 35 (66%) participants who tried the online tools completed them, suggesting that such tools are, in principle, acceptable to many autistic adults. In addition, adults in the cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy conditions reported significant decreases in anxiety over 3 and to some extent also 6 months that were less apparent in the waitlist group of participants. On broader measures of mental health and well-being, the benefits of the online tools were less apparent. Overall, the results suggest that online self-help cognitive behaviour therapy and mindfulness-based therapy tools should be explored further as a means of providing cost-effective mental health support to at least those autistic individuals who can engage effectively with such online tools.","The authors would like to thank Richard Latham, Rebecca Millard and the team at Wellmind Media for supporting this study and providing free access to the Be Mindful online programme.

Animal literature demonstrates that antibiotic use, which affects the composition of the maternal gut microbiota, modifies the effect of MIA on neurodevelopmental outcomes in the offspring. The aim of this study was to assess whether antibiotic use during pregnancy modifies the association between MIA and subsequent risk of ASD, in a prospective birth cohort with 116 ASD cases and 860 typically developing (TD) child controls. There was no evidence of interaction between fever or genitourinary infection and antibiotic use on the odds of ASD in unadjusted or adjusted analyzes. However, we found evidence of an interaction between flu, specifically in second trimester, and antibiotic use at any point during pregnancy on the odds of ASD in the child. Among women who received an antibiotic during pregnancy, flu in trimester two was not associated with ASD (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 0.99 [0.43-2.28]). Among women who were not exposed to an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy, flu in second trimester was significantly associated with increased odds of ASD (aOR = 4.05 [1.14-14.38], P = .03), after adjustment for child sex, child birth year, maternal age, gestational age, C-section delivery, and low birthweight. These findings should be treated as hypothesis-generating and suggest that antibiotic use may modify the influence that MIA has on autism risk in the child. LAY SUMMARY: We looked at whether the association between activation of the immune system during pregnancy and risk of the child developing autism spectrum disorder (ASD) differed among women who did or did not take an antibiotic at any point during pregnancy.

An increasing number of studies have focused on the development of training programs and have shown promising results. However, most of these programs are appropriate for individuals with high-functioning ASC (HFA) but exclude individuals with low-functioning ASC (LFA). We have developed a computer-based game called JeStiMulE based on logical skills to teach emotions to individuals with ASC, independently of their age, intellectual, verbal and academic level.The aim of the present study was to verify the usability of JeStiMulE (which is its adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency) on a heterogeneous ASC group. We hypothesized that after JeStiMulE training, a performance improvement would be found in emotion recognition tasks.MethodsA heterogeneous group of thirty-three children and adolescents with ASC received two one-hour JeStiMulE sessions per week over four weeks. In order to verify the usability of JeStiMulE, game data were collected for each participant. Furthermore, all participants were presented before and after training with five emotion recognition tasks, two including pictures of game avatars (faces and gestures) and three including pictures of real-life characters (faces, gestures and social scenes).ResultsDescriptive data showed suitable adaptability, effectiveness and efficiency of JeStiMulE. Results revealed a significant main effect of Session on avatars (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 98.48, P < .001) and on pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (1,32) = 49.09, P < .001). A significant Session × Task × Emotion interaction was also found for avatars (ANOVA: F (6,192) = 2.84, P = .01). This triple interaction was close to significance for pictures of real-life characters (ANOVA: F (12,384) = 1.73, P = .057). Post-hoc analyses revealed that 30 out of 35 conditions found a significant increase after training.ConclusionsJeStiMulE appears to be a promising tool to teach emotion recognition not only to individuals with HFA but also those with LFA. JeStiMulE is thus based on ASC-specific skills, offering a model of logical processing of social information to compensate for difficulties with intuitive social processing.Trial registrationComité de Protection des Personnes Sud Méditerranée V (CPP): reference number 11.046 (https://cpp-sud-mediterranee-v.fr/).","We are grateful to all children, adolescents and their families for their participation in this study.

For many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD), reading comprehension is a noted area of challenge. For children with typical development, it is well established that successful reading comprehension requires two broad skills: word reading and oral language. For children with ASD, word reading is often believed to be relatively intact, even in the face of poor reading comprehension, suggesting that deficits in oral language, more than in word reading, underlie reading comprehension deficits. Yet, extant research has suggested the importance of both skills. To clarify the role of these skills in the reading comprehension of children with ASD, we conducted a meta-analysis. ERIC, PsycINFO, PubMed, and Proquest Dissertation & Theses were searched for studies of reading comprehension in children with ASD, published up to May 2019. We identified 26 relevant studies about children with ASD (aged 6-18 years) that included both a measure of word reading and reading comprehension. Hunt-Schmidt Random Effects Models showed similar mean correlations between reading comprehension and the component skills of word reading (M r = 0.65 [0.27-1.03]) and oral language (M r = 0.61 [0.33-0.88]). These findings demonstrate that these skills are essential for reading comprehension in children with ASD, making contributions of similar size. This study advances our understanding of the mechanisms by which children with ASD understand what they read, providing a foundation on which to build programmatic research into each of these mechanisms. LAY SUMMARY: Academic progress is closely tied to children's ability to understand what they read. Yet reading comprehension is difficult for many children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We used a statistical method to summarize existing research on the skills that children with ASD use to understand what they read. We found that the reading comprehension of children with ASD was related to a similar extent to both their ability to read individual words and their oral language skills. These findings suggest that both areas should be assessed in order to determine appropriate interventions to support reading comprehension for children with ASD.

Social and communication differences that autistic individuals experience can act as a risk factor during these interactions, as shown by public reports of negative and violent encounters between autistic individuals and the law enforcement. There is a clear need for evidence-based strategies to reduce high rates of contact and to improve outcomes when an interaction occurs. This article provides a systematic review of research on autism spectrum disorder and criminal justice system to compile this evidence base. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analysis structure was used to identify 89 articles after searching six databases. The Sequential Intercept Model describes the criminal justice system as different stages, or intercepts, that are connected, and the Sequential Intercept Model serves as an overall framework to organize the included articles. Articles were analyzed to identify research themes at each intercept, which offer guidance for policy and program changes that support equitable justice for autistic individuals.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Criminal Law; Humans; Policy,24/01/2022,2022,24/01/2022,2022-07,26,5,1014-1031,Closed,Article,"Cooper, Dylan S; Uppal, Disha; Railey, Kirsten S; Wilson, Amy Blank; Maras, Katie; Zimmerman, Emily; Bornman, Juan; Shea, Lindsay L","Cooper, Dylan S (A.J.

A total of 25,063/1,548,819 (1.6%) had autism: 19,880 (79.3%) males and 5183 (20.7%) females.

However, the same may not be true for children with autism spectrum disorder. Using an economic trust game, the current study revealed that like typical children, children with autism spectrum disorder rationally modulate their trust behaviour based on non-face cues to partner trustworthiness (e.g. reputation information). Critically, however, they are no more likely to place their trust in partners with faces that look trustworthy to them, than those that look untrustworthy. These results cannot be accounted for by any group differences in children's conceptualization of trustworthiness, ability to read trustworthiness from faces or understanding of the experimental paradigm. Instead, they seem to suggest that there may be a selective failure to spontaneously use facial cues to trustworthiness to guide behaviour in an ecologically valid context.","We thank Eleni Avard, Samantha Bank, Libby Taylor and Nichola Burton for assistance with testing and all of the children, families, community groups and schools who kindly volunteered their time to participate.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Child; Comprehension; Cues; Humans; Interpersonal Relations; Male; Psychological Tests; Social Perception; Trust,17/12/2014,2014,17/12/2014,2015-11,19,8,1002-1009,All OA; Green,Article,"Ewing, Louise; Caulfield, Frances; Read, Ainsley; Rhodes, Gillian","Ewing, Louise (ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Western Australia, Australia; Birkbeck, University of London, UK); Caulfield, Frances (ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Western Australia, Australia); Read, Ainsley (ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Western Australia, Australia); Rhodes, Gillian (ARC Centre of Excellence in Cognition and its Disorders, School of Psychology, University of Western Australia, Australia)","Ewing, Louise (University of Western Australia; Birkbeck, University of London)","Ewing, Louise (University of Western Australia; Birkbeck, University of London); Caulfield, Frances (University of Western Australia); Read, Ainsley (University of Western Australia); Rhodes, Gillian (University of Western Australia)","Birkbeck, University of London; University of Western Australia",grid.88379.3d; grid.1012.2,United Kingdom; Australia,,24,5,1.08,2.89,19,https://ueaeprints.uea.ac.uk/id/eprint/57281/1/Ewing_et_al._2014_Autism.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1018231322,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,,No,,,

Autistic and neurotypical children completed vibrotactile tasks assessing reaction time, amplitude discrimination (sequential and simultaneous) and temporal discrimination (temporal order judgment and duration discrimination). Autistic children had elevated and more variable reaction times, suggesting slower perceptual-motor processing speed and/or greater distractibility. Children with autism also showed higher amplitude discrimination and temporal order judgement thresholds compared to neurotypical children. Tactile perceptual metrics did not associate with social or tactile sensitivities measured by parent-reports. Altered tactile behavioral responses appear in early childhood, can be quantified but appear dissociated from sensitivity. This implies these measures are complementary, but not necessarily related, phenomena of atypical tactile perception in autism.",,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",,28/04/2022,2022,28/04/2022,28/04/2022,,,Jan-14,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Espenhahn, Svenja; Godfrey, Kate J.; Kaur, Sakshi; McMorris, Carly; Murias, Kara; Tommerdahl, Mark; Bray, Signe; Harris, Ashley D.","Espenhahn, Svenja (Department of Radiology, Cumming School of Medicine, University of Calgary Alberta Children’s Hospital, Office B4-512 28 Oki Drive NW, T3B 6A8, Calgary, AB, Canada; Owerko Centre, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada; Hotchkiss Brain Institute, University of Calgary, Calgary, AB, Canada); Godfrey, Kate J.

While recent literature postulates anxiety as a mechanism encompassing an underlying amygdala-related elevated baseline level of arousal even to nonthreatening cues, whether this same mechanism contributes to anxiety in those with an ASC and supports the transdiagnostic nature of anxiety remains elusive. In this case-control study of 51 youths (26 ASC), we assessed autism and anxiety via the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and the State-Trait Anxiety Inventory, respectively. Hemodynamic responses, including amygdala reactivity, to explicit and implicit (backwardly masked) perception of threatening faces were acquired using functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging (fMRI). For explicit fear, ASC individuals showed significantly greater negative correlations between the amygdala and the attentional deployment-parietal network. For implicit fear, ASC individuals showed significantly stronger correlations of the amygdala with the prefrontal networks, temporal pole, and hippocampus. Additionally, an fMRI-based neurologic signature for anxiety in ASCs was identified via the LibSVM machine learning model using amygdala-centered functional connectivity during the emotional processing of explicit and implicit stimuli. Hypervigilance to implicit threat in ASCs comorbid with anxiety might exacerbate explicit threat reactivity; hence the use of attentional avoidance patterns to restrict affective hyperarousal for explicitly perceived socioemotional stimuli. Consequently, developing an attention-independent behavioral/neural marker identifying anxiety in ASCs is highly warranted. LAY SUMMARY: This study identifies a dissociation of amygdala reactivity dependent on explicit and implicit threat processing. Implicit anxiety in individuals with an autism spectrum condition (ASC) could outweigh explicitly induced threat. When explicitly perceiving socioemotional stimuli, ASC individuals with anxiety might use attentional avoidance patterns to restrict affective hyperarousal.","The study was funded by the Ministry of Science and Technology (MOST 108‐2410‐H‐010‐005‐MY3; 108‐2410‐H‐155‐041‐MY3; 109‐2636‐H‐038‐001‐; 110‐2636‐H‐038‐001‐), National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Hospital (RD2021‐003), Taipei City Hospital (11001‐62‐039), Taipei Medical University (DP2‐108‐21121‐01‐N‐03‐03), and the Brain Research Center, National Yang‐Ming University from The Featured Areas Research Center Program within the framework of the Higher Education Sprout Project by the Ministry of Education (MOE) in Taiwan (108BRC‐B501).",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Adolescent; Amygdala; Anxiety; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Case-Control Studies; Facial Recognition; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging,23/08/2021,2021,23/08/2021,2021-11,14,11,2287-2299,Closed,Article,"Chen, Yu‐Chun; Chen, Chenyi; Martínez, Róger Marcelo; Fan, Yang‐Tang; Liu, Chia‐Chien; Chen, Chin‐Yau; Cheng, Yawei","Chen, Yu‐Chun (Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Hospital, Yilan, Taiwan; Department of Physical Education, National Taiwan University of Sport, Taichung, Taiwan); Chen, Chenyi (Graduate Institute of Injury Prevention and Control, College of Public Health, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Brain and Consciousness Research Center, Shuang‐Ho Hospital, Taipei Medical University, New Taipei City, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Mind, Brain and Consciousness, College of Humanities and Social Sciences, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Psychiatric Research Center, Wan Fang Hospital, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan); Martínez, Róger Marcelo (Graduate Institute of Injury Prevention and Control, College of Public Health, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; School of Psychological Sciences, National Autonomous University of Honduras, Tegucigalpa, Honduras); Fan, Yang‐Tang (Graduate Institute of Medicine, Yuan Ze University, Taoyuan, Taiwan); Liu, Chia‐Chien (Department of Psychiatry, Taichung Veterans General Hospital, Taichung, Taiwan; Institute of Neuroscience and Brain Research Center, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan); Chen, Chin‐Yau (Department of Surgery, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Hospital, Yilan, Taiwan); Cheng, Yawei (Department of Physical Medicine & Rehabilitation, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University Hospital, Yilan, Taiwan; Institute of Neuroscience and Brain Research Center, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Education and Research, Taipei City Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan)","Cheng, Yawei (; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Taipei City Hospital)","Chen, Yu‐Chun (National Taiwan University of Sport); Chen, Chenyi (Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University; Wan Fang Hospital); Martínez, Róger Marcelo (Taipei Medical University; National Autonomous University of Honduras); Fan, Yang‐Tang (Yuan Ze University); Liu, Chia‐Chien (Taichung Veterans General Hospital; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University); Chen, Chin‐Yau (National Yang Ming University Hospital); Cheng, Yawei (National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Taipei City Hospital)",Taipei City Hospital; Yuan Ze University; Taipei Medical University; National Autonomous University of Honduras; National Taiwan University of Sport; National Yang Ming University Hospital; Taipei Medical University-Shuang Ho Hospital; Wan Fang Hospital; National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Taichung Veterans General Hospital,grid.410769.d; grid.413050.3; grid.412896.0; grid.10601.36; grid.445057.7; grid.470147.1; grid.412955.e; grid.416930.9; grid.260539.b; grid.410764.0,Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan; Honduras; Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan,National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University; Ministry of Science and Technology; Ministry of Education; Taipei City Hospital,3,3,,,2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1140588472,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,Yes,https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT04549506?term=NCT04549506&draw=2&rank=1,Observational ,Retrospective registration

This work, however, has been limited by a focus on the brain activity of a single person during computerized social tasks rather than exploring brain activity during in vivo interactions. The current study assessed neural synchronization during a conversation as a mechanism for social impairment in adults with ASD (n = 24) and matched controls (n = 26). Functional near-infrared spectroscopy (fNIRS) data were collected from the prefrontal cortex (PFC) and tempoparietal junction (TPJ). Participants self-reported on their social communication and videos of the interaction were coded for utterances and conversational turns. As expected, controls showed more neural synchrony than participants with ASD in the TPJ. Also as expected, controls showed less social communication impairment than participants with ASD. However, participants with ASD did not have fewer utterances compared with control subjects. Overall, less neural synchrony in the TPJ was associated with higher social impairment and marginally fewer utterances. Our findings advance our understanding of social difficulties in ASD by linking them to decreased neural synchronization of the TPJ. LAY SUMMARY: The coordination of brain responses is important for efficient social interactions. The current study explored the coordination of brain responses in neurotypical adults and adults with ASD to investigate if difficulties in social interactions are related to difficulties coordinating brain responses in ASD. We found that participants with ASD had more difficulties coordinating brain responses during a conversation with an interacting partner. Additionally, we found that the level of coordination in brain responses was linked to problems with social communication.",The authors have no conflict of interest to declare.

Participants were administered a survey covering the ASD diagnostic process. Parents had developmental concerns early but experienced long wait times and usually attended many appointments. Mean diagnostic age was 3.26 years and overall delay was 1.20 years. Stress and being told there was “no problem” were significantly associated with parental satisfaction with the process.

We conducted a placebo-controlled trial of DCS to potentiate social skills training in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) but found substantial improvement in both the DCS and placebo groups at the conclusion of active treatment. Here, we assess the impact of DCS 11 weeks following active treatment to evaluate the impact of DCS on treatment response durability.MethodsStudy participants included 60 outpatient youth with ASD, ages 5–11 years, all with IQ above 70, and significantly impaired social functioning who completed a 10-week active treatment phase during which they received weekly single doses of 50 mg of DCS or placebo administered 30 min prior to group social skills training. Following the 10-week active treatment phase, blinded follow-up assessments occurred at week 11 and week 22. The primary outcome measure for our durability of treatment evaluation was the parent-rated social responsiveness scale (SRS) total raw score at week 22.ResultsAnalysis of the SRS total raw score demonstrated significant decrease for the DCS group compared to the placebo group (p = 0.042) indicating greater maintenance of treatment effect in the DCS group. DCS was well tolerated, with irritability being the most frequently reported adverse effect in both groups.ConclusionsThe findings of this study suggest that DCS may help youth with ASD to maintain skills gained during sort-term social skills training. Larger-scale studies with longer follow-up will be necessary to further understand the long-term impact of DCS paired with structured social skills training.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov, NCT01086475","We would like to acknowledge the contributions of Sarah Hurwitz PhD (Indiana University School of Medicine) and Stacie Pozdol MA (Indiana University School of Medicine), for the study design and group execution.

However, ALFF and fALFF have been used only sporadically to study autism. rs-fMRI data from 69 children (40 autistic, mean age = 8.47 ± 2.20 years; age range: 5.2 to 13.2; and 29 non-autistic, mean age = 9.02 ± 1.97 years; age range 5.9 to 12.9) were obtained from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange (ABIDE II). ALFF and fALFF were measured using CONN connectivity toolbox and SPM12, at whole-brain & network-levels. A two-sampled t-test and a 2 Group (autistic, non-autistic) × 7 Networks ANOVA were conducted to test group differences in ALFF and fALFF. The whole-brain analysis identified significantly reduced ALFF values for autistic participants in left parietal opercular cortex, precuneus, and right insula. At the network level, there was a significant effect of diagnostic group and brain network on ALFF values, and only significant effect of network, not group, on fALFF values. Regression analyses indicated a significant effect of age on ALFF values of certain networks in autistic participants. Such intrinsically different network-level responses in autistic participants may have implications for task-level recruitment and synchronization of brain areas, which may in turn impact optimal cognitive functioning. Moreover, differences in low frequency fluctuations of key networks, such as the DMN and SN, may underlie alterations in brain responses in autism that are frequently reported in the literature.",This study was supported by the University of Alabama College of Arts and Sciences Faculty Funds to R.K.

While investigations of AAI for children with autism have been conducted, the extant literature is characterized by significant variability in methodology and practice. The present meta-analysis examines the aggregated effects of equine AAI on adaptive functioning among children with autism. Results indicated that interacting with an equine specifically during AAI produced small-to-medium effects (g = 0.40) on the adaptive functioning of children with autism. Recommendations are made for future research on this topic.","This manuscript is based on a master’s thesis project completed in May 2020 that was presented to faculty of Towson University in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the degree Master of Arts in (Experimental) Psychology.

The experience of emotion is important however, because it can relate to difficulties like anxiety and depression, which are common in autism. In neurotypical adults and children, different emotions have been associated with unique maps of activity patterns in the body. Whether these maps of emotion are comparable in autism is currently unknown. Here, we asked 100 children and adolescents, 45 of whom were autistic, to color in outlines of the body to indicate how they experienced seven emotions. Autistic adults and children sometimes report differences in how they experience their internal bodily states, termed interoception, and so we also investigated how this related to the bodily maps of emotion. In this study, the autistic children and adolescents had comparable interoception to the non-autistic children and adolescents, but there was less variability in their maps of emotion. In other words, they showed more similar patterns of activity across the different emotions. This was not related to interoception, however. This work suggests that there are differences in how autistic people experience emotion that are not explained by differences in interoception. In neurotypical people, less variability in emotional experiences is linked to anxiety and depression, and future work should seek to understand if this is a contributing factor to the increased prevalence of these difficulties in autism.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Emotions; Humans; Interoception; Sensation,22/01/2021,2021,22/01/2021,2021-07,25,5,1321-1334,All OA; Green,Article,"Palser, Eleanor R; Galvez-Pol, Alejandro; Palmer, Clare E; Hannah, Ricci; Fotopoulou, Aikaterini; Pellicano, Elizabeth; Kilner, James M","Palser, Eleanor R (University College London, UK; University of California San Francisco, USA); Galvez-Pol, Alejandro (University College London, UK; University of the Balearic Islands, Spain); Palmer, Clare E (University College London, UK; University of California San Diego, USA); Hannah, Ricci (University College London, UK; University of California San Diego, USA); Fotopoulou, Aikaterini (University College London, UK); Pellicano, Elizabeth (University College London, UK; Macquarie University, Australia); Kilner, James M (University College London, UK)","Palser, Eleanor R (University College London; University of California, San Francisco)","Palser, Eleanor R (University College London; University of California, San Francisco); Galvez-Pol, Alejandro (University College London; University of the Balearic Islands); Palmer, Clare E (University College London; University of California, San Diego); Hannah, Ricci (University College London; University of California, San Diego); Fotopoulou, Aikaterini (University College London); Pellicano, Elizabeth (University College London; Macquarie University); Kilner, James M (University College London)","University College London; University of California, San Francisco; University of the Balearic Islands; University of California, San Diego; Macquarie University",grid.83440.3b; grid.266102.1; grid.9563.9; grid.266100.3; grid.1004.5,United Kingdom; United States; Spain; United States; Australia,Leverhulme Trust; European Research Council; Economic and Social Research Council; Medical Research Council,5,5,,,28,https://discovery.ucl.ac.uk/10120256/3/Fotopoulou_Reduced%20differentiation%20of%20emotion-associated%20bodily%20sensations%20in%20autism_AAM.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134808178,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,No,,,

In a series of three experiments, the impact of this profile on the perception of regional dialect was examined. Young adults with High-Functioning Autism exhibited similar performance to a typically developing comparison group in regional dialect classification and localness rating tasks, suggesting that they can use indexical information in speech to make judgments about the regional background of unfamiliar talkers. However, the participants with High-Functioning Autism were less able to differentiate among the dialects in a language attitudes task, suggesting that they do not share social stereotypes related to dialect variation with the typically developing comparison group.","This research was partially funded by a seed grant from the Ohio State University Center for Cognitive Science.

However, the causes of these co-occurring difficulties are not well understood. Perceptual processing atypicalities are also often reported in individuals with ASD, but how these relate to co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems remains unclear, and few studies have used objective measurement of perceptual processing.MethodsEvent-related potentials (ERPs) were recorded in response to both standard and deviant stimuli (which varied in pitch) in an auditory oddball paradigm in adolescents (mean age of 13.56 years, SD = 1.12, range = 11.40–15.70) with ASD (n = 43) with a wide range of IQ (mean IQ of 84.14, SD = 24.24, range 27–129). Response to deviant as compared to standard stimuli (as indexed by the mismatch negativity (MMN)) and response to repeated presentations of standard stimuli (habituation) were measured. Multivariate regression tested the association between neural indices of perceptual processing and co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems.ResultsGreater sensitivity to changes in pitch in incoming auditory information (discrimination), as indexed by increased MMN amplitude, was associated with higher levels of parent-rated behaviour problems. MMN amplitude also showed a trend positive correlation with parent-rated sensory hyper-sensitivity. Conversely, greater habituation at the later N2 component was associated with higher levels of emotional problems. Upon more detailed analyses, this appeared to be driven by a selectively greater ERP response to the first (but not the second or third) standard stimuli that followed deviant stimuli. A similar pattern of association was found with other measures of anxiety. All results remained in covariation analyses controlling for age, sex and IQ, although the association between MMN amplitude and behaviour problems became non-significant when controlling for ASD severity.ConclusionsFindings suggest that alterations in mechanisms of perceptual processing and discrimination may be important for understanding co-occurring emotional and behavioural problems in young people with ASD.","We thank Drs.

In the same time window, de-synchronization in the beta band in the amygdala was reduced in the ASD group across conditions.ConclusionsThis is the first demonstration of atypical global and local synchrony patterns in the social brain in adults with ASD during implicit processing of emotional faces. The present results replicate and substantially extend previous findings on adolescents, highlighting that atypical brain synchrony during processing of socio-emotional stimuli is a hallmark of clinical sequelae in autism.","The authors would like to thank Marc Lalancette for help in data collection, as well as Anne Keller and Simeon Wong for support in the data analysis.

The current study describes the parental stress of 118 fathers and 118 mothers at the onset of their children’s Early Intensive Behavioral Intervention program. The objectives of the study were to compare and analyze each parent’s stress and to identify factors that might predict their stress. Results indicated that fathers reported higher levels of stress than mothers. Correlations indicated that the stress levels of both parents were associated with their child’s age, intellectual quotient, severity of autistic symptoms, and adaptive behaviors. Paternal stress, but not maternal stress, was predicted by severity of autistic symptoms and child’s gender. Results are discussed in terms of their implications for services and early interventions.","We would like to acknowledge the financial support that we received during this research project.

This study hypothesized that such intermediate phenotypes could be identified in white matter tracts of the social communication model that exhibited reduced tract integrity and associations with social communication deficits. Boys with ASD (N = 30), unaffected male siblings (N = 27), and typically developing (TD) boys (N = 30) underwent clinical evaluation and MRI scanning. Group differences in generalized fractional anisotropy (GFA) values, a white matter integrity index derived from diffusion MRI data, and the relationships of GFA with the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS) scores and the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL/4-18) scores were investigated. Significant differences were found in the GFA values of the frontal aslant tract (FAT) among the three groups, with the decreasing order of GFA from TD to siblings to ASD. The GFA values of the FAT were associated with the social communication scores (on the SRS) in the sibling group, and those of the superior longitudinal fasciculus III were associated with the social problems scores (on the CBCL/4-18) in the boys with ASD. Due to the altered tract integrity and association with social communication deficits in the unaffected siblings of individuals with ASD, the FAT might be a heritable neural basis for social communication deficits of ASD.

LAY SUMMARY: Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a group of highly heritable disorders with social communication deficits as one of the core symptoms. This study aimed to identify a neural trait of social communication deficits in individuals with ASD. We investigated brain structural alterations and their associations with social communication scores in unaffected siblings of individuals with ASD. The siblings' frontal aslant tract was found to be impaired, and this tract showed a significant association with the social communication scores. Our findings support that the frontal aslant tract might be a potential neural trait of social communication deficits in ASD.","This work was mainly supported by the Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC 101‐2314‐B‐002‐136‐MY3), and partially supported by the Ministry of Economic Affairs (103‐EC‐17‐A‐19‐S1‐175), Taipei Medical University (TMU104‐AE1‐B34), National Health Research Institutes (NHRI‐EX104‐10404PI, NHRI‐EX105‐10404PI, NHRI‐EX106‐10404PI, NHRI‐EX107‐10404PI), and the Ministry of Science and Technology (NSC99‐2321‐B‐002‐037, NSC100‐2321‐B‐002‐015, NSC101‐2627‐B‐002‐002, MOST 105‐2314‐B‐038‐084, MOST 106‐2314‐B‐038‐021) in Taiwan.",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Communication; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Siblings; Social Behavior; Taiwan; White Matter,12/12/2018,2018,12/12/2018,2019-02,12,2,225-238,Closed,Article,"Lo, Yu‐Chun; Chen, Yu‐Jen; Hsu, Yung‐Chin; Chien, Yi‐Ling; Gau, Susan Shur‐Fen; Tseng, Wen‐Yih Isaac","Lo, Yu‐Chun (Institute of Medical Device and Imaging, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Ph.D. Program for Neural Regenerative Medicine, College of Medical Science and Technology, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan; Research Center of Brain and Consciousness, Taipei Medical University, Taipei, Taiwan); Chen, Yu‐Jen (Institute of Medical Device and Imaging, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan); Hsu, Yung‐Chin (Institute of Medical Device and Imaging, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan); Chien, Yi‐Ling (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan); Gau, Susan Shur‐Fen (Department of Psychiatry, National Taiwan University Hospital and College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan); Tseng, Wen‐Yih Isaac (Institute of Medical Device and Imaging, National Taiwan University College of Medicine, Taipei, Taiwan; Graduate Institute of Brain and Mind Sciences, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan; Department of Medical Imaging, National Taiwan University Hospital, Taipei, Taiwan; Molecular Imaging Center, National Taiwan University, Taipei, Taiwan)","Gau, Susan Shur‐Fen (National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University); Tseng, Wen‐Yih Isaac (National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University)","Lo, Yu‐Chun (National Taiwan University; Taipei Medical University; Taipei Medical University); Chen, Yu‐Jen (National Taiwan University); Hsu, Yung‐Chin (National Taiwan University); Chien, Yi‐Ling (National Taiwan University Hospital); Gau, Susan Shur‐Fen (National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University); Tseng, Wen‐Yih Isaac (National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital; National Taiwan University)",Taipei Medical University; National Taiwan University; National Taiwan University Hospital,grid.412896.0; grid.19188.39; grid.412094.a,Taiwan; Taiwan; Taiwan,Taipei Medical University; Ministry of Science and Technology; National Health Research Institutes; Ministry of Economic Affairs,12,9,0.72,2.22,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1110578678,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,

Using a systematic review, we synthesized estimates of the prevalence of autism worldwide. We examined factors accounting for variability in estimates and critically reviewed evidence relevant for hypotheses about biological or social determinants (viz., biological sex, sociodemographic status, ethnicity/race, and nativity) potentially modifying prevalence estimates of autism. We performed the search in November 2021 within Medline for studies estimating autism prevalence, published since our last systematic review in 2012. Data were extracted by two independent researchers. Since 2012, 99 estimates from 71 studies were published indicating a global autism prevalence that ranges within and across regions, with a median prevalence of 100/10,000 (range: 1.09/10,000 to 436.0/10,000). The median male-to-female ratio was 4.2. The median percentage of autism cases with co-occurring intellectual disability was 33.0%. Estimates varied, likely reflecting complex and dynamic interactions between patterns of community awareness, service capacity, help seeking, and sociodemographic factors. A limitation of this review is that synthesizing methodological features precludes a quality appraisal of studies. Our findings reveal an increase in measured autism prevalence globally, reflecting the combined effects of multiple factors including the increase in community awareness and public health response globally, progress in case identification and definition, and an increase in community capacity. Hypotheses linking factors that increase the likelihood of developing autism with variations in prevalence will require research with large, representative samples and comparable autism diagnostic criteria and case-finding methods in diverse world regions over time. LAY SUMMARY: We reviewed studies of the prevalence of autism worldwide, considering the impact of geographic, ethnic, and socioeconomic factors on prevalence estimates. Approximately 1/100 children are diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder around the world. Prevalence estimates increased over time and varied greatly within and across sociodemographic groups. These findings reflect changes in the definition of autism and differences in the methodology and contexts of prevalence studies.","The work was supported by Fonds de Recherche du Québec Santé (FRQS), and Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR).",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Ethnicity; Female; Humans; Male; Population Surveillance; Prevalence,03/03/2022,2022,03/03/2022,2022-05,15,5,778-790,All OA; Green,Article,"Zeidan, Jinan; Fombonne, Eric; Scorah, Julie; Ibrahim, Alaa; Durkin, Maureen S.; Saxena, Shekhar; Yusuf, Afiqah; Shih, Andy; Elsabbagh, Mayada","Zeidan, Jinan (Montreal Neurological Institute‐Hospital, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, McGill University Montreal, Montreal, Canada); Fombonne, Eric (Department of Psychiatry, Oregon Health and Science University, Portland, Oregon, USA); Scorah, Julie (Montreal Neurological Institute‐Hospital, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, McGill University Montreal, Montreal, Canada); Ibrahim, Alaa (Montreal Neurological Institute‐Hospital, Faculty of Medicine & Health Sciences, McGill University Montreal, Montreal, Canada); Durkin, Maureen S.

For this reason, we investigated the validity of a proposed sub-typology of autistic adults detained in secure psychiatric hospitals. Initially, we ran a focus group with psychiatrists, clinical psychologists, healthcare workers, family members and autistic adults who had been detained in hospital to consider a sub-typology of autistic adults who may come into contact with secure psychiatric hospitals. We asked 15 psychiatrists and clinical psychologists to rate 10 clinical vignettes based on our sub-typology with three rounds; revisions to the vignettes to improve clarity were made following each round. The findings indicated that these subtypes possess face validity and raters were able to classify all 10 clinical case vignettes into the sub-typology and percentage of agreement ranged from 96% to 100% for overall subtype classification. The findings suggested that the further validity of the sub-typology should be investigated within a larger study using a clinical sample. These subtypes may help inform treatment and care pathways within hospital.","The authors thank all the participating sites, staff and participants for their valuable contribution to this study.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Crime; Hospitals, Psychiatric; Humans; Reproducibility of Results",20/06/2020,2020,20/06/2020,2020-10,24,7,1885-1897,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Barnoux, Magali; Alexander, Regi; Bhaumik, Sabyasachi; Devapriam, John; Duggan, Connor; Shepstone, Lee; Staufenberg, Ekkehart; Turner, David; Tyler, Nichola; Viding, Essi; Langdon, Peter E","Barnoux, Magali (University of Kent, UK); Alexander, Regi (University of East Anglia, UK); Bhaumik, Sabyasachi (University of Leicester, UK); Devapriam, John (Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust, UK); Duggan, Connor (University of Nottingham, UK); Shepstone, Lee (University of East Anglia, UK); Staufenberg, Ekkehart (Hertfordshire Partnership University NHS Trust, UK); Turner, David (University of East Anglia, UK); Tyler, Nichola (University of Victoria, New Zealand); Viding, Essi (University College London, UK); Langdon, Peter E (Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust and University of Warwick, UK)","Langdon, Peter E (Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust)","Barnoux, Magali (University of Kent); Alexander, Regi (University of East Anglia); Bhaumik, Sabyasachi (University of Leicester); Devapriam, John (Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust); Duggan, Connor (University of Nottingham); Shepstone, Lee (University of East Anglia); Staufenberg, Ekkehart (); Turner, David (University of East Anglia); Tyler, Nichola (Victoria University of Wellington); Viding, Essi (University College London); Langdon, Peter E (Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust)",University of East Anglia; University of Leicester; University College London; Coventry and Warwickshire Partnership NHS Trust; University of Nottingham; University of Kent; Worcestershire Health and Care NHS Trust; Victoria University of Wellington,grid.8273.e; grid.9918.9; grid.83440.3b; grid.502740.4; grid.4563.4; grid.9759.2; grid.501217.0; grid.267827.e,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; New Zealand,Department of Health and Social Care; National Institute for Health Research,1,1,0.23,0.46,26,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320929457,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1128658454,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,No,,,

However, there are few studies that separate aberrant sensory responses by individual sensory modality to assess modality-specific associations between sensory features and core symptoms. Differences in response to tactile stimuli are prevalent in ASD, and tactile contact early in infancy is a foundation for the development of social and communication skills affected by ASD. We assessed the association between three aberrant patterns of tactile responsiveness (hyper-responsiveness, hypo-responsiveness, sensory seeking) and core symptoms of ASD. Both sensory and core features were measured with converging methods including both parent-report and direct observation. Our results demonstrate that for the tactile modality, sensory hypo-responsiveness correlates strongly with increased social and communication impairments, and to a lesser degree, repetitive behaviors. Sensory seeking was found to correlate strongly with social impairment, nonverbal communication impairment, and repetitive behaviors. Surprisingly, tactile hyper-responsiveness did not significantly correlate with any core features of ASD.

Therefore, this study garnered information on clinicians’ perspectives regarding perceived facilitators and barriers when rendering participation-based interventions using a qualitative research design. Semi-structured interviews of clinicians (Ns = 12, 25–57 years) were conducted and evaluated via an inductive thematic analysis. Results denote that current mechanisms of providing participation-based interventions resembled traditionally focused interventions; thus, resulting in a knowledge-to-practice gap. Clinicians desired more opportunities to communicate with caregivers and to be able to influence the children’ s natural environments. They also identified shortness of time, resources, and rigid health care regulations as barriers hampering the efficacy of participation-based services.","We would like to acknowledge all the participants for participating in this study.

Research on PM in ASD has produced mixed results. We aimed to establish the extent to which two types of PM (event-based/time-based) are impaired in ASD. In part 1, a meta-analysis of all existing studies indicates a large impairment of time-based, but only a small impairment of event-based PM in ASD. In Part 2, a critical review concludes that time-based PM appears diminished in ASD, in line with the meta-analysis, but that caution should be taken when interpreting event-based PM findings, given potential methodological limitations of several studies.

During inhibition tasks, adults with ASD show reduced activation of and connectivity between brain areas implicated in inhibition, suggesting impairments in inhibitory control at the neural level. Our study further investigated these differences by using magnetoencephalography (MEG) to examine the frequency band(s) in which functional connectivity underlying response inhibition occurs, as brain functions are frequency specific, and whether connectivity in certain frequency bands differs between adults with and without ASD.MethodsWe analysed MEG data from 40 adults with ASD (27 males; 26.94 ± 6.08 years old) and 39 control adults (27 males; 27.29 ± 5.94 years old) who performed a Go/No-go task. The task involved two blocks with different proportions of No-go trials: Inhibition (25% No-go) and Vigilance (75% No-go). We compared whole-brain connectivity in the two groups during correct No-go trials in the Inhibition vs. Vigilance blocks between 0 and 400 ms.ResultsDespite comparable performance on the Go/No-go task, adults with ASD showed reduced connectivity compared to controls in the alpha band (8–14 Hz) in a network with a main hub in the right inferior frontal gyrus. Decreased connectivity in this network predicted more self-reported difficulties on a measure of inhibition in everyday life.LimitationsMeasures of everyday inhibitory control were not available for all participants, so this relationship between reduced network connectivity and inhibitory control abilities may not be necessarily representative of all adults with ASD or the larger ASD population. Further research with independent samples of adults with ASD, including those with a wider range of cognitive abilities, would be valuable.ConclusionsOur findings demonstrate reduced functional brain connectivity during response inhibition in adults with ASD. As alpha-band synchrony has been linked to top-down control mechanisms, we propose that the lack of alpha synchrony observed in our ASD group may reflect difficulties in suppressing task-irrelevant information, interfering with inhibition in real-life situations.","We would like to thank Simeon Wong, MyLoi Huynh-Silveira, Julie Lu Patranoiu, Rianne Hastie Adams, Rachael Lyon, Katharine Coons, Marc Lalancette, Tammy Rayner, and Ruth Weiss for their assistance in recruitment, data collection, and/or analyses, as well as Rachel Leung for her help with ADOS-2 administration.

Increasingly, studies include comparisons between sexes or genders, but few have focused on clarifying the characteristics of autistic girls’/women’s physical health.MethodsA scoping review was conducted to determine what is currently known about the physical health of autistic girls/women. We screened 1112 unique articles, with 40 studies meeting the inclusion criteria. We used a convergent iterative process to synthesize this content into broad thematic areas.ResultsAutistic girls/women experience more overall physical health challenges compared to non-autistic girls/women and to autistic boys/men. Emerging evidence suggests increased prevalence of epilepsy in autistic girls/women compared to non-autistic girls/women and to autistic boys/men. The literature also suggests increased endocrine and reproductive health conditions in autistic girls/women compared to non-autistic girls/women. Findings regarding gastrointestinal, metabolic, nutritional, and immune-related conditions are preliminary and inconsistent.LimitationsThe literature has substantial heterogeneity in how physical health conditions were assessed and reported. Further, our explicit focus on physical health may have constrained the ability to examine interactions between mental and physical health. The widely differing research aims and methodologies make it difficult to reach definitive conclusions. Nevertheless, in keeping with the goals of a scoping review, we were able to identify key themes to guide future research.ConclusionsThe emerging literature suggests that autistic girls/women have heightened rates of physical health challenges compared to non-autistic girls/women and to autistic boys/men. Clinicians should seek to provide holistic care that includes a focus on physical health and develop a women’s health lens when providing clinical care to autistic girls/women.",Not applicable.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Autistic Disorder; Female; Health Status; Humans; Women's Health,27/10/2020,2020,27/10/2020,2020-12,11,1,84,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kassee, Caroline; Babinski, Stephanie; Tint, Ami; Lunsky, Yona; Brown, Hilary K.; Ameis, Stephanie H.; Szatmari, Peter; Lai, Meng-Chuan; Einstein, Gillian","Kassee, Caroline (The Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth and Family Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 80 Workman Way, M6J 1H4, Toronto, ON, Canada; Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); Babinski, Stephanie (Dalla Lana School of Public Health, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada; Department of Sociology, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); Tint, Ami (The Margaret and Wallace McCain Centre for Child, Youth and Family Mental Health, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, 80 Workman Way, M6J 1H4, Toronto, ON, Canada; Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada); Lunsky, Yona (Azrieli Adult Neurodevelopmental Centre, Centre for Addiction and Mental Health, Toronto, Canada; Department of Psychiatry, Faculty of Medicine, University of Toronto, Toronto, Canada); Brown, Hilary K.

Recent evidence suggests temporal processing deficits may also be characteristic of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, little is known about the factors that impact temporal processing in children with ASD. The purpose of this study was to assess the effects of co-morbid attention problems, working memory (WM), age, and their interactions, on time reproduction in youth with and without ASD. Twenty-seven high-functioning individuals with ASD and 25 demographically comparable typically developing individuals (ages 9-17; 85% male) were assessed on measures of time reproduction, auditory WM, and inattention/hyperactivity. The time reproduction task required depression of a computer key to mimic interval durations of 4, 8, 12, 16, or 20 sec. Mixed effects regression analyses were used to model accuracy and variability of time reproduction as functions of diagnostic group, interval duration, age, WM, and inattention/hyperactivity. A significant group by age interaction was detected for accuracy, with the deficit in the ASD group being greater in younger children. There was a significant group by WM interaction for consistency, with the effects of poor WM on performance consistency being more pronounced in youth with ASD. All participants tended to underestimate longer interval durations and to be less consistent for shorter interval durations; these effects appeared more pronounced in those who were younger or who had poorer WM performance. Inattention/hyperactivity symptoms in the ASD group were not related to either accuracy or consistency. This study highlights the potential value of temporal processing as an intermediate trait of relevance to multiple neurodevelopmental disorders.",We would like to thank all the families for generously donating their time so that this study could be possible.

Supported employment enables individuals with autism to secure and maintain a paid job in a regular work environment. The objective of this study was to assess the cost-effectiveness of supported employment compared with standard care (day services) for adults with autism in the United Kingdom. Thus, a decision-analytic economic model was developed, which used outcome data from the only trial that has evaluated supported employment for adults with autism in the United Kingdom. The main analysis considered intervention costs, while cost-savings associated with changes in accommodation status and National Health Service and personal social service resource use were examined in secondary analyses. Two outcome measures were used: the number of weeks in employment and the quality-adjusted life year. Supported employment resulted in better outcomes compared with standard care, at an extra cost of £18 per additional week in employment or £5600 per quality-adjusted life year. In secondary analyses that incorporated potential cost-savings, supported employment dominated standard care (i.e. it produced better outcomes at a lower total cost). The analysis suggests that supported employment schemes for adults with autism in the United Kingdom are cost-effective compared with standard care. Further research needs to confirm these findings.","We thank Jasdeep Hayre for useful comments and suggestions in the development of the economic model, Naomi Glover for assistance with data extraction and methodological assessment of included trials and Sarah Stockton for creating the search strategies and conducting the database searches used for the autism in adults guideline.",Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Adult; Autistic Disorder; Cost-Benefit Analysis; Employment, Supported; Female; Humans; Male; United Kingdom",14/10/2013,2013,14/10/2013,2014-11,18,8,975-984,All OA; Green,Article,"Mavranezouli, Ifigeneia; Megnin-Viggars, Odette; Cheema, Nadir; Howlin, Patricia; Baron-Cohen, Simon; Pilling, Stephen","Mavranezouli, Ifigeneia (University College London, UK); Megnin-Viggars, Odette (Royal College of Psychiatrists, UK); Cheema, Nadir (University College London, UK); Howlin, Patricia (King’s College London, UK); Baron-Cohen, Simon (Cambridge University, UK; NIHR CLAHRC for Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust, UK); Pilling, Stephen (University College London, UK)","Mavranezouli, Ifigeneia (University College London)","Mavranezouli, Ifigeneia (University College London); Megnin-Viggars, Odette (Royal College of Psychiatrists); Cheema, Nadir (University College London); Howlin, Patricia (King's College London); Baron-Cohen, Simon (University of Cambridge; Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust); Pilling, Stephen (University College London)",Royal College of Psychiatrists; University of Cambridge; Cambridgeshire and Peterborough NHS Foundation Trust; University College London; King's College London,grid.452735.2; grid.5335.0; grid.450563.1; grid.83440.3b; grid.13097.3c,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Medical Research Council,57,17,1.65,6.49,50,https://europepmc.org/articles/pmc4230968?pdf=render,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1010971938,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being; 8 Decent Work and Economic Growth,No,,,

The biological basis of deficits in social cognition in ASD, and their difficulty in processing emotional face information in particular, remains unclear. Atypical communication within and between brain regions has been reported in ASD. Interregional phase-locking is a neurophysiological mechanism mediating communication among brain areas and is understood to support cognitive functions. In the present study we investigated interregional magnetoencephalographic phase synchronization during the perception of emotional faces in adolescents with ASD.MethodsA total of 22 adolescents with ASD (18 males, mean age =14.2 ± 1.15 years, 22 right-handed) with mild to no cognitive delay and 17 healthy controls (14 males, mean age =14.4 ± 0.33 years, 16 right-handed) performed an implicit emotional processing task requiring perception of happy, angry and neutral faces while we recorded neuromagnetic signals. The faces were presented rapidly (80 ms duration) to the left or right of a central fixation cross and participants responded to a scrambled pattern that was presented concurrently on the opposite side of the fixation point. Task-dependent interregional phase-locking was calculated among source-resolved brain regions.ResultsTask-dependent increases in interregional beta synchronization were observed. Beta-band interregional phase-locking in adolescents with ASD was reduced, relative to controls, during the perception of angry faces in a distributed network involving the right fusiform gyrus and insula. No significant group differences were found for happy or neutral faces, or other analyzed frequency ranges. Significant reductions in task-dependent beta connectivity strength, clustering and eigenvector centrality (all P <0.001) in the right insula were found in adolescents with ASD, relative to controls.ConclusionsReduced beta synchronization may reflect inadequate recruitment of task-relevant networks during emotional face processing in ASD. The right insula, specifically, was a hub of reduced functional connectivity and may play a prominent role in the inability to effectively extract emotional information from faces. These findings suggest that functional disconnection in brain networks mediating emotional processes may contribute to deficits in social cognition in this population.","The authors would like to thank Olivia Turosky for her assistance with data analyses, Dr Jessica A Brian, Heather Leckey, and Becky Baatjes for their assistance with ADOS administration and supervision, Marc Lalancette, Tamara Powell, and Vanessa Vogan for their assistance with data collection and Dr Maher Quraan for his assistance with beamforming analyses.

Autism spectrum disorders (ASD) are a group of complex childhood-onset neurodevelopmental and genetic disorders characterized by deficits in language development and verbal communication, impaired reciprocal social interaction, and the presence of repetitive behaviors or restricted interests. The study aimed to identify novel genes associated with the pathogenesis of ASD.MethodsWe conducted comparative total gene expression profiling analysis of lymphoblastoid cell lines (LCL) between 16 male patients with ASD and 16 male control subjects to screen differentially expressed genes associated with ASD. We verified one of the differentially expressed genes, FOXP1, using real-time quantitative PCR (RT-qPCR) in a sample of 83 male patients and 83 male controls that included the initial 16 male patients and male controls, respectively.ResultsA total of 252 differentially expressed probe sets representing 202 genes were detected between the two groups, including 89 up- and 113 downregulated genes in the ASD group.

We then used preclinical PET imaging for an unbiased analysis of the whole brain of these mice and studied the function of the piriform cortex by c-Fos immunoreactivity and HPLC.ResultsCompared to control animals, VPA-exposed animals play less as juveniles and exhibit a lower frequency of social interaction in adulthood when reared with other VPA mice. In addition, these animals were less likely to investigate social odors in the habituation/dishabituation olfactory test. However, when VPA animals were weaned with control animals, these behavioral alterations were not observed. Interestingly, repetitive behaviors and depression-related behaviors were not affected by social enrichment. We also found that VPA animals present high levels of glucose metabolism bilaterally in the piriform cortex (Pir), a region known to be involved in social behaviors. Moreover, we found alterations in the somatosensory, motor, and insular cortices. Remarkably, these effects were mostly reversed after social stimulation. To evaluate if changes in glucose metabolism in the Pir correlated with changes in neuronal activity, we measured c-Fos immunoreactivity in the Pir and found it increased in animals prenatally exposed to VPA. We further found increased dopamine turnover in the Pir. Both alterations were largely reversed by social enrichment.ConclusionsWe show that early social enrichment can specifically rescue social deficits in a mouse model of ASD. Our results identified the Pir as a structure affected by VPA-exposure and social enrichment, suggesting that it could be a key component of the social brain circuitry.","We want to thank the staff of the Laboratory of Preclinical Imaging, especially to Ms. Nadia Levanovich for the contribution in image acquisitions and animal care.

They were rated with the behavior rating inventory of executive function (BRIEF) and the autism diagnostic interview revised (ADI-R). We found a positive association between EF and the ADI-R domains of reciprocal social interaction (p < 0.001) and communication (p = 0.001) in girls, while these relationships were small and non-significant in boys.

Research indicates heightened levels of camouflaging behaviours in the adult autistic population. To extend understanding of camouflaging in adolescents, this mixed-methods study explored camouflaging behaviours in offline and online contexts with 40 autistic and 158 non-autistic adolescents. At the quantitative phase, participants completed measures of camouflaging behaviours (online vs offline) and measures of social media use. Following this, six autistic adolescents participated in semi-structured interviews. Findings indicate that in the offline context, autistic adolescents camouflage more than non-autistic adolescents. Online, autistic participants camouflage less than they do offline, and females camouflage more than males. Implications for research and theory are discussed.","This research received no specific grant from any funding agency in the public, commercial, or not-for-profit sectors.

Subclinical autism-like characteristics have also been found at elevated rates in relatives of autistic probands. Physical and psychiatric conditions have been reported at elevated rates in autistic children and adults, and also in their relatives. However, to date, there has been no exploration of how aging may affect this pattern. This study examined cross-sectional data from the ongoing online PROTECT study. A total of 20,220 adults aged 50 years and older reported whether they have an autistic first-degree relative. In total, 739 older adults reported having an autistic first-degree relative (AFDR group) and 11,666 were identified as having no family history of any neurodevelopmental disorder (NFD group). The AFDR group demonstrated significantly higher frequencies of self-reported psychiatric diagnoses and a greater total number of co-occurring psychiatric diagnoses than the NFD group. Furthermore, the AFDR group reported elevated current self-report symptoms of depression, anxiety, traumatic experience, and post-traumatic stress than the NFD group. By contrast, few differences between AFDR and NFD groups were observed in physical health conditions, and no differences were observed in the total number of co-occurring physical health diagnoses. These findings suggest that adults who have an AFDR may be at greater risk of poor mental, but not physical, health in later life. Older adults with autistic relatives may benefit from close monitoring to mitigate this susceptibility and to provide timely intervention. Autism Res 2020, 13: 641-654. © 2020 The Authors.

However, a few studies have explored what happens when these individuals get older. Examining over 20,000 adults age 50+, we found that older adults with an autistic relative experienced elevated rates of most psychiatric conditions but not physical conditions.

We argued that teachers’ attitudes toward their inclusion represent a key factor to understand this issue. Based on previous research showing that teachers are frequently reluctant to include them in mainstream education, we hypothesized that teachers’ attitudes could be predicted by the specific difficulties faced by these students. Method One thousand and sixty-four teachers were asked to express their attitudes toward the inclusion of students with ASD in an online questionnaire. The co-occurring difficulties that students with ASD could face were experimentally manipulated through brief information depicting specific set of difficulties. Results Teachers expressed more positive attitudes toward the inclusion of students with ASD with no difficulties, in comparison with those with behavioral difficulties, behavioral and cognitive difficulties, or those for whom difficulties were not specified – the control condition. Unexpectedly, teachers were not more positive regarding the inclusion of students with ASD with no difficulties in comparison with those with cognitive difficulties. Conclusions Without specific information, it seems that teachers spontaneously associated ASD with behavioral difficulties and that teachers’ attitudes were the most negative for students facing such difficulties (regardless of the presence or absence of cognitive difficulties). Nonetheless, by also suggesting that attitudes toward the inclusion of these students can be positive, these results seem to corroborate that the use of broader categories like “students with ASD” could be discussed.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2021-05,2021,,2021-05,83,,101746,All OA; Green,Article,"Jury, Mickaël; Perrin, Anne-Laure; Desombre, Caroline; Rohmer, Odile","Jury, Mickaël (Université Clermont Auvergne, ACTé, F-63000, Clermont-Ferrand, France); Perrin, Anne-Laure (Univ.

The current study aimed to develop a theory-driven factor structure of the AQ that would fit as well across samples as the 12 previously proposed factor structures, all of which, except for the original Baron-Cohen model, had been developed on the basis of exploratory factor analysis (EFA) or principal component analysis. We first proposed a six-factor solution: (1) social anhedonia; (2) interest in details/patterns; (3) imagination ability; (4) desire for predictability/routine; (5) social cognition; and (6) social discourse convention. We tested the six-factor structure and made final item selections (27 items) with EFA using data from college students (n = 503). Then, we empirically tested alternative factor structure models in three other independent samples (ns = 503; 1263; 1641) using confirmatory factor analysis. Results indicated that our model fit as well, if not better, than all of the other models across samples, regardless of parameter estimation methods and software packages. Overall, the theory-driven replicable six-factor structure that we report holds the potential to be used to measure the six domains of features that we identified in the AQ. LAY SUMMARY: Questionnaire measures of autism spectrum conditions have typically been used to measure approximately four broad dimensions. Our study suggests that the Autism-Spectrum Quotient can be used to measure six more narrowly defined dimensions: social anhedonia, interest in details/patterns, imagination ability, desire for predictability/routine, social cognition, and social discourse convention. Additional work is needed to develop measures of a much wider variety of autism spectrum features.","We thank Rosa Hoekstra, Danielle Cath, and Dorret Boomsma for kindly sharing their data, collection of which was supported by The Netherlands Organization for Scientific Research (NWO, grant number 575‐25‐006; NWO/SPI 56‐464‐14192 and NWO Groot [480‐15‐001/674] Netherlands Twin Registry Repository: researching the interplay between genome and environment), and Michael English for kindly sharing his data, collection of which was supported by an Australian Research Council Discovery Project grant (DP190103286).",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806","Anhedonia; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Factor Analysis, Statistical; Humans; Surveys and Questionnaires",04/06/2022,2022,04/06/2022,2022-09,15,9,1710-1718,Closed,Article,"Zhu, Yiqin; Mu, Wenting; Chirica, Marianne G.; Berenbaum, Howard","Zhu, Yiqin (Department of Psychiatry, University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA); Mu, Wenting (Department of Psychology, Tsinghua University, Beijing, China); Chirica, Marianne G.

Clinical initiatives have aimed to reduce the age at ASD diagnosis in the UK. This study investigated whether the median age at diagnosis in childhood has reduced in recent years, and identified the factors associated with earlier diagnosis in the UK. Data on 2134 children with ASD came from two large family databases. Results showed that the age of ASD diagnosis has not decreased. The median age of diagnosis of all ASDs was 55 months. Factors associated with earlier age of diagnosis were autism diagnosis (compared with other ASD), language regression, language delay, lower socioeconomic status, and greater degree of support required. Effective clinical strategies are needed to identify children with characteristics that have in the past delayed ASD diagnosis.","We are grateful to the parents and children participating in ASD-UK and Daslne, and the child health teams, who through recruitment have made a huge contribution to the success of the databases.

Impaired inhibition has been suggested to exacerbate the core symptoms of ASD. This is particularly critical during adolescence when social skills are maturing to adult levels. Using magnetoencephalography (MEG), we identified the location and timing pattern of neural activity associated with inhibition in adolescents with autism, compared to typically developing adolescents.MethodsThe MEG data from 15 adolescents with ASD and 15 age-matched controls (13 to 17 years) were collected during a go/no-go task with inverse ratios of go/no-go trials in two conditions: an inhibition condition (1:2) and a baseline condition (2:1). No-go trials from the two conditions were analyzed using beamformer source localizations from 200 ms to 400 ms post-stimulus onset. Significant activations were determined using permutation testing.ResultsAdolescents with ASD recruited first the right middle frontal gyrus (200 to 250 ms) followed by the left postcentral gyrus (250 to 300 ms) and finally the left middle frontal and right medial frontal gyri (300 to 400 ms). Typically developing adolescents recruited first the left middle frontal gyrus (200 to 250 ms), followed by the left superior and inferior frontal gyri (250 to 300 ms), then the right middle temporal gyrus (300 to 350 ms), and finally the superior and precentral gyri and right inferior lobule (300 to 400 ms).ConclusionsAdolescents with ASD showed recruitment limited largely to the frontal cortex unlike typically developing adolescents who recruited parietal and temporal regions as well. These findings support the presence of an atypical, restricted inhibitory network in adolescents with ASD compared to controls.","The authors would like to thank Marc Lalancette, Hamzah Qureshi, and Travis Mills for their assistance with the analyses.

The goal of this study was to examine the role of various factors in university students’ acceptance of, and intention to volunteer with, a peer with ASD. Both contact quantity and quality emerged as significant predictors of acceptance; however, for those who had experienced direct contact with individuals with ASD, only perceived quality emerged as significant. Moreover, acceptance played a significant role in participants’ likelihood of signing up to volunteer. These findings point to the central role that positive experiences play in attitude formation for this population.","This research was supported by scholarships from the Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and the Autism Research Training (ART) program funded by the Canadian Institutes of Health Research (CIHR) to the first author, and a grant from Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council of Canada (SSHRC) and a Michael Smith Foundation for Health Research (MSFHR) Scholar Award to the second.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Adolescent; Adult; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Female; Humans; Intention; Male; Peer Group; Students; Universities; Volunteers; Young Adult",28/09/2013,2013,28/09/2013,2014-05,44,5,1008-1017,Closed,Article,"Gardiner, Emily; Iarocci, Grace","Gardiner, Emily (Department of Psychology, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, V5A 1S6, Burnaby, BC, Canada); Iarocci, Grace (Department of Psychology, Simon Fraser University, 8888 University Drive, V5A 1S6, Burnaby, BC, Canada)","Gardiner, Emily (Simon Fraser University)","Gardiner, Emily (Simon Fraser University); Iarocci, Grace (Simon Fraser University)",Simon Fraser University,grid.61971.38,Canada,Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council; Michael Smith Health Research BC; Canadian Institutes of Health Research,83,25,2.43,17.03,1,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1026826002,39 Education; 3904 Specialist Studies In Education,,No,,,

Mentalising is often measured by the Frith-Happé Animations task, where individuals need to interpret the interactions of abstract shapes. This review article collated results from over 3000 people to assess how autistic people performed on the task. Analysis showed that autistic people tended to underperform compared to non-autistic people on the task, although the scale of the difference was moderate rather than large. Also, autistic people showed some difficulty with the non-mentalising as well as mentalising aspects of the task. These results raise questions about the scale and specificity of mentalising difficulties in autism. It also remains unclear how well mentalising difficulties account for the social challenges diagnostic of autism.",The author would like to thank Professor Dorothy Bishop for comments on this article.,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Humans; Reading; Theory of Mind,23/02/2021,2021,23/02/2021,2021-07,25,5,1175-1186,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Wilson, Alexander C","Wilson, Alexander C (University of Oxford, UK)","Wilson, Alexander C (University of Oxford)","Wilson, Alexander C (University of Oxford)",University of Oxford,grid.4991.5,United Kingdom,,3,3,,,13,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361321989152,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1135671560,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,,No,,,Open Data

The current study investigates whether between-person differences in ADHD traits are associated with differences in the within-person moment-to-moment coupling of stress and negative affect; and whether these can explain between-person differences in internalising problems (N = 262, median-age 20). Results of a dynamic structural equation model indicated that between-person differences in ADHD traits significantly moderated the daily life coupling between stress and negative affect. Further, higher ADHD traits were associated with stronger stress carry-over and higher mean levels of negative affect. Stress carry-over and mean levels of negative affect mediated the association between ADHD traits and internalising problems.","The authors are grateful to the children, parents and teachers who provided data for the z-proso study and the research assistants involved in its collection.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",,08/06/2022,2022,08/06/2022,08/06/2022,,,01-Nov,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Speyer, Lydia Gabriela; Brown, Ruth Harriet; Ribeaud, Denis; Eisner, Manuel; Murray, Aja Louise","Speyer, Lydia Gabriela (Department of Psychology, University of Cambridge, Downing Site, Cambridge, CB2 3EA, Cambridge, United Kingdom; Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom); Brown, Ruth Harriet (Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom); Ribeaud, Denis (Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland); Eisner, Manuel (Jacobs Center for Productive Youth Development, University of Zurich, Zurich, Switzerland; Violence Research Centre, Institute of Criminology, University of Cambridge, Cambridge, United Kingdom); Murray, Aja Louise (Department of Psychology, University of Edinburgh, Edinburgh, United Kingdom)","Speyer, Lydia Gabriela (University of Cambridge; University of Edinburgh)","Speyer, Lydia Gabriela (University of Cambridge; University of Edinburgh); Brown, Ruth Harriet (University of Edinburgh); Ribeaud, Denis (University of Zurich); Eisner, Manuel (University of Zurich; University of Cambridge); Murray, Aja Louise (University of Edinburgh)",University of Cambridge; University of Zurich; University of Edinburgh,grid.5335.0; grid.7400.3; grid.4305.2,United Kingdom; Switzerland; United Kingdom,Swiss National Science Foundation; Jacobs Foundation; Federal Office of Public Health,1,1,,,4,https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10803-022-05624-w.pdf,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1148518173,52 Psychology; 5205 Social and Personality Psychology,,No,,,

Twenty-one verbally fluent autistic adults and 21 typically developing controls engaged in a controlled conversational task. Group differences were observed in both semantic/pragmatic and motoric features of spontaneously produced co-speech gestures. Autistic adults prioritized different functions of co-speech gesture. Specifically, they used gesture more than controls to facilitate conversational turn-taking, demonstrating a novel nonverbal strategy for regulating conversational dynamics. Autistic adults were more likely to gesture unilaterally than bilaterally, a motoric feature of gesture that was individually associated with autism symptoms. Co-speech gestures may provide a link between nonverbal communication symptoms and known differences in motor performance in autism.","At the time of the study, all authors were affiliated with the Center for Autism Research at the Children’s Hospital of Philadelphia.

This network has been named the default mode network. Furthermore, differences in the default mode network are the most consistent findings in neuroimaging research in autism. Recent studies suggest that the default mode network is composed of subnetworks that are tied to different functions, namely memory and understanding others' minds. In this study, we investigated if default mode network differences in autism are related to specific subnetworks of the default mode network and if these differences change across childhood and adolescence. Our results suggest that the subnetworks of the default mode network are less differentiated in autism in middle childhood compared to neurotypicals. By late adolescence, the default mode network subnetwork organisation was similar in the autistic and neurotypical groups. These findings provide a foundation for future studies to investigate if this developmental pattern relates to improvements in the integration of memory and social understanding as autistic children grow up.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Brain; Brain Mapping; Child; Default Mode Network; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Neural Pathways,27/11/2020,2020,27/11/2020,2021-02,25,2,556-565,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Bathelt, Joe; Geurts, Hilde M","Bathelt, Joe (Royal Holloway, University of London, UK); Geurts, Hilde M (University of Amsterdam, The Netherlands)","Bathelt, Joe (Royal Holloway University of London)","Bathelt, Joe (Royal Holloway University of London); Geurts, Hilde M (University of Amsterdam)",University of Amsterdam; Royal Holloway University of London,grid.7177.6; grid.4970.a,Netherlands; United Kingdom,Dutch Research Council,10,10,1.32,4.48,7,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1362361320969258,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1133120189,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,Open Code

Children with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) show impairments in performance on inhibitory control tasks. Nevertheless, the research on the neural correlates of these impairments is inconclusive. Here, we explore the integrity of inhibitory control networks in children with ASD and typically developing (TD) children using resting state functional Magnetic Resonance Imagaing (MRI). In a large multisite sample, we find evidence for significantly greater functional connectivity (FC) of the right inferior frontal junction (rIFJ) with the posterior cingulate gyrus, and left and right frontal poles in children with ASD compared with TD children. Additionally, TD children show greater FC of rIFJ with the superior parietal lobule (SPL) compared with children with ASD. Furthermore, although higher rIFJ-SPL and rIFJ-IPL FC was related to better inhibitory control behaviors in both ASD and TD children, rIFJ-dACC FC was only associated with inhibitory control behaviors in TD children. These results provide preliminary evidence of differences in intrinsic functional networks supporting inhibitory control in children with ASD, and provide a basis for further exploration of the development of inhibitory control in children with the disorder.

LAY SUMMARY: Inhibitory control is an important process in healthy cognitive development. Behavioral studies suggest that inhibitory control is impaired in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). However, research examining the neural correlates underlying inhibitory control differences in children with ASD is inconclusive. This study reveals differences in functional connectivity of brain networks important for inhibitory control in children with ASD compared with typically developing children. Furthermore, it relates brain network differences to parent-reported inhibitory control behaviors in children with ASD. These findings provide support for the hypothesis that differences in brain connectivity may underlie observable behavioral deficits in inhibitory control in children with the disorder.","Grant sponsor: National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH), Grant number: R01MH107549 to L.Q.U.

This study extended upon this background by combining DCS with behavioral social skills therapy in youth with ASD to assess its impact on the core social deficits of ASD. We hypothesized that DCS used in combination with social skills training would enhance the acquisition of social skills in children with ASD.MethodsA 10-week, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of DCS (50 mg) given 30 min prior to weekly group social skills training was conducted at two sites. Children with ASD were randomized to receive 10 weeks (10 doses) of DCS or placebo in a 1:1 ratio.ResultsNo statistically significant difference attributable to drug treatment was observed in the change scores for the primary outcome measure, the Social Responsiveness Scale (SRS), total score (p = 0.45), or on secondary outcome measures.ConclusionsThe results of this trial demonstrated no drug-related short-term improvement on the primary outcome measure, or any of the secondary outcome measures. However, an overall significant improvement in SRS total raw score was observed from baseline to end of treatment for the entire group of children with ASD. This suggests a need to further study the efficacy of the social skills training protocol.

This study examined the efficacy of cognitive enhancement therapy (CET) for improving core cognitive and employment outcomes in adult autism. Verbal adult outpatients with autism spectrum disorder (N = 54) were randomized to an 18-month, single-blind trial of CET, a cognitive remediation approach that integrates computer-based neurocognitive training with group-based training in social cognition, or an active enriched supportive therapy (EST) comparison focused on psychoeducation and condition management. Primary outcomes were composite indexes of neurocognitive and social-cognitive change. Competitive employment was a secondary outcome. Intent-to-treat analyses indicated that CET produced significant differential increases in neurocognitive function relative to EST (d = .46, P = .013). Both CET and EST were associated with large social-cognitive improvements, with CET demonstrating an advantage at 9 (d = .58, P = 0.020), but not 18 months (d = .27, P = 0.298). Effects on employment indicated that participants treated with CET were significantly more likely to gain competitive employment than those in EST, OR = 6.21, P = 0.023, which was mediated by cognitive improvement. CET is a feasible and potentially effective treatment for core cognitive deficits in adult autism spectrum disorder. The treatment of cognitive impairments in this population can contribute to meaningful improvements in adult outcomes.

The app signaled the onset of urination, time-stamped accidents for analysis, reminded parents to reinforce intervals of continence, provided a visual outlet for parents to communicate reinforcement, and afforded opportunity for timely feedback from clinicians. We compared this intervention with an intervention that uses standard behavioral treatment in a pilot randomized controlled trial of 33 children with autism spectrum disorder aged 3-6 years with urinary incontinence. Parents in both groups received initial training and four booster consultations over 3 months. Results support the feasibility of parent-mediated toilet training studies (e.g., 84% retention rate, 92% fidelity of parent-implemented intervention). Parents used the app and related technology with few difficulties or malfunctions. There were no statistically significant group differences for rate of urine accidents, toilet usage, or satisfaction at close of intervention or 3-month follow-up; however, the alarm group trended toward greater rate of skill acquisition with significantly less day-to-day intervention.

Copy number variations (CNVs) as one of the genetic factors associated with ASD have been addressed in recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS). However, the significance of CNV has not been well investigated in non-Caucasian ASD population.MethodsTo identify the pathogenic CNVs responsible for ASD in Han Chinese, we performed a segment-based GWAS of CNV in 335 ASD cases and 1093 healthy controls using Affymetrix single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array by focusing on case-specific CNVs. PARK2 was one of the important genes with several case-specific regions overlapped on it. The findings were validated in the initial screen sample set and replicated in another sample set by real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR).ResultsA total of six CNVs at 6q26 that spanned different exons of PARK2 were identified. The PARK2 expression level was down-regulated at exon-dependent manner in cases with either deletion or duplication. The result revealed that the gene function might be disrupted by exonic deletion and duplication. We also observed that the ASD case with exonic duplication demonstrated a more severe interference of PARK2 expression and the clinical feature than the ones with deletion at the exons 2–4 of the PARK2 gene.ConclusionsOur finding provides evidence to support that CNVs affecting PARK2 function might contribute to genetic etiology of a proportion of cases with ASD. The intriguing results of this work warrant further study on characterizing the functional impact of various exonic CNVs on the PARK2 gene.Trial registrationClinicalTrials.gov NCT00494754","We thank the National Center for Genome Medicine of the National Core Facility Program for Biotechnology, Minister of Science and Technology, for the technical support.

A Study of Interactions with Humans and Human-Controlled Avatars,"Few direct comparisons have been made between the responsiveness of children with autism to computer-generated or animated characters and their responsiveness to humans. Twelve 4- to 8-year-old children with autism interacted with a human therapist; a human-controlled, interactive avatar in a theme park; a human actor speaking like the avatar; and cartoon characters who sought social responses. We found superior gestural and verbal responses to the therapist; intermediate response levels to the avatar and the actor; and poorest responses to the cartoon characters, although attention was equivalent across conditions. These results suggest that even avatars that provide live, responsive interactions are not superior to human therapists in eliciting verbal and non-verbal communication from children with autism in this age range.","Financial support for this research was provided by Disney Research, Pittsburgh.

This study compared the volume and functional connectivity (FC) strength of three FC-defined amygdala subregions between ASD and controls, and assessed their relation to social skills in ASD. A subregion associated with the social perception network was enlarged in ASD (F1 = 7.842, p = .008) and its volume correlated significantly with symptom severity (social skills: r = .548, p = .009).

Recent methodological advances, however, have shown that this same pattern of reduced FA may be an artifact resulting from excessive head motion and poorer data quality and that aberrant structural connectivity in children with ASD is confined to the right inferior longitudinal fasciculus (ILF). This study aimed at replicating the observation of reduced FA along the right ILF in ASD, while controlling for group differences in head motion and data quality. In addition, we explored associations between reduced FA in the right ILF and quantitative ASD characteristics, and the involvement of the right ILF in visual processing, which is known to be altered in ASD.MethodGlobal probabilistic tractography was performed on diffusion-weighted imaging data of 17 adolescent boys with ASD and 17 typically developing boys, matched for age, performance IQ, handedness, and data quality. Four tasks were administered to measure various aspects of visual information processing, together with questionnaires assessing ASD characteristics. Group differences were examined and the neural data were integrated with previously published findings using Bayesian statistics to quantify evidence for replication and to pool data and thus increase statistical power. (Partial) correlations were calculated to investigate associations between measures.ResultsThe ASD group showed consistently reduced FA only in the right ILF and slower performance on the visual search task. Bayesian statistics pooling data across studies confirmed that group differences in FA were confined to the right ILF only, with the evidence for altered FA in the left ILF being indecisive. Lower FA in the right ILF tended to covary with slower visual search and a more fragmented part-oriented processing style. Individual differences in FA of the right ILF were not reliably associated with the severity of ASD traits after controlling for clinical status.ConclusionOur findings support the growing evidence for reduced FA along a specific fiber tract in ASD, the right ILF.","We thank all participating children and their families for their time and effort.

These difficulties might also reflect fundamental deficits in integrating visual signals. We contrasted predictions of a social perception and a spatial–temporal integration deficit account. Participants with ASD and matched controls performed two tasks: the first required spatiotemporal integration of global motion signals without social meaning, the second required processing of socially relevant local motion. The ASD group only showed differences to controls in social motion evaluation. In addition, gray matter volume in the temporal–parietal junction correlated positively with accuracy in social motion perception in the ASD group. Our findings suggest that social–perceptual difficulties in ASD cannot be reduced to deficits in spatial–temporal integration.","We especially would like to thank all volunteers who participated in this study.

The temporal lexical route visually maps whole words to their lexical entries, whilst the nonlexical route decodes words phonologically via parietal cortex. Readers typically employ the lexical route for familiar words, but poor comprehension plus precocity at mechanically ‘sounding out’ words suggests that differences might exist in autism. Combined MEG/EEG recordings of adults with autistic spectrum conditions (ASC) and controls while reading revealed preferential recruitment of temporal areas in controls and additional parietal recruitment in ASC. Furthermore, a lack of differences between semantic word categories was consistent with previous suggestion that people with ASC may lack a ‘default’ lexical-semantic processing mode. These results are discussed with reference to dual-route models of reading.","We thank Clare Cook, Lucy MacGregor and Olaf Hauk at the MRC Cognition and Brain Sciences Unit for their advice and assistance at different stages of stimulus preparation, MEG/EEG recording and analysis; we would also like to thank Carrie Allison and Bonnie Auyeung at the Autism Research Centre for their help with participant recruitment.

Cognitive behaviour therapy (CBT) is frequently used to treat these symptoms. Hence, a systematic review was undertaken to synthesise published data about the effectiveness of CBT interventions for adults with ASD and psychiatric co-morbidity. Only six studies met pre-determined review inclusion criteria: two RCTs; one quasi-experimental study; one case series; and two case studies. Meta-analysis was not possible due to study heterogeneity. A narrative analysis of the data suggested that CBT interventions – including behavioural, cognitive, and mindfulness-based techniques – were moderately effective treatments for co-morbid anxiety and depression symptoms, albeit that sample sizes were small, participant characteristics varied widely, and psychometric properties of self-report outcome measurements utilised in the ASD population remain subject to some debate. Several studies described adaptations to standard CBT including an increase in the number of sessions, or accommodation of core ASD characteristics and associated neuropsychological impairments within the therapy process. We suggest further empirical research is needed to (1) investigate the acceptability and effectiveness of a range of CBT interventions for adults who have ASD and co-morbidity, and (2) to identify which adaptations are requisite for optimising CBT techniques and outcomes in this population.","DS is funded by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Doctoral Research Fellowship (CDRF-2012-03-059).

Better understanding of this profile will be essential to identify and remove potential barriers to diagnosis. Using an abbreviated form of the Diagnostic Interview for Social and Communication Disorders, comparisons were drawn between the profile of a sample of able adults diagnosed in adulthood and the profile of a sample of able children. Results revealed both similarities and differences. A relative strength in non-verbal communication highlighted a potential barrier to diagnosis according to DSM-5 criteria for the adult sample, which may also have prevented them from being diagnosed as children.","The authors would like to acknowledge the contributions of Dr Judith Gould, Dr Rachel Kent, Prof. Jeremy Hall, Dr Helen Matthews, Prof. Dale Hay, Prof. Ina van Berckelaer-Onnes, and Leiden University.",Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432",Adult; Autistic Disorder; Communication Disorders; Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders; Female; Humans; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Surveys and Questionnaires,07/09/2019,2019,07/09/2019,2019-12,49,12,5036-5046,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Carrington, Sarah J.; Barrett, Sarah L.; Sivagamasundari, Umapathy; Fretwell, Christine; Noens, Ilse; Maljaars, Jarymke; Leekam, Susan R.","Carrington, Sarah J.

Children with ASD and DD with ASD symptoms had mild to severe ASD risk on several measures compared to children with other DD and POP who had little ASD risk across measures.

The study included 65 participants who were divided into low cognitive (developmental quotient < 85; N = 41) and high cognitive (developmental quotient ⩾ 85; N = 21) groups in adolescence. Participants underwent a comprehensive assessment of cognitive ability, adaptive skills, and autism severity. Significant differences in the current clinical phenotypes and in developmental changes over time were found between the two cognitive groups. At baseline, the high cognitive group had significantly less severe social communication deficits. Only the high cognitive group showed a decrease in social communication deficits over time. Although the two groups did not differ in their adaptive skills at the time of diagnosis, the high cognitive group had better adaptive skills at adolescence. Better adaptive communication skills in toddlerhood were associated with better outcome at adolescence in cognitive ability, adaptive skills, and fewer autism symptoms. Less impaired baseline social affect and better cognitive ability predicted higher cognitive level and adaptive skills at adolescence. Cognitive potential of individuals with autism spectrum disorder plays an important role in long-term outcome and comprehensive evaluations at toddlerhood have strong prognostic value in adolescence.","We would like to thank the Israeli National Association for Children with Autism (ALUT) for logistic support and our research assistant, Tamar Matz Vaisman, for her extensive help throughout the project.

Diagnostic evaluations for ASD typically include the autism diagnostic observation schedule (ADOS-2), a semi-structured assessment composed of a series of social presses. The current study examined associations between concurrent objective features of child vocalizations during the ADOS-2 and examiner-rated autism symptom severity. The sample included 66 children (49 male; M = 40 months, SD = 10.58) evaluated in a university-based clinic, 61 of whom received an ASD diagnosis. Research reliable administration of the ADOS-2 provided social affect (SA) and restricted and repetitive behavior (RRB) calibrated severity scores (CSS). Audio was recorded from examiner-worn eyeglasses during the ADOS-2 and child and adult speech were differentiated with LENA SP Hub. PRAAT was used to ascertain acoustic features of the audio signal, specifically the mean fundamental vocal frequency (F0) of LENA-identified child speech-like vocalizations (those with phonemic content), child cry vocalizations, and adult speech. Sphinx-4 was employed to estimate child and adult phonological features indexed by the average consonant and vowel count per vocalization. More than a quarter of the variance in ADOS-2 RRB CSS was predicted by the combination of child phoneme count per vocalization and child vocalization F0. Findings indicate that both acoustic and phonological features of child vocalizations are associated with expert clinician ratings of autism symptom severity. LAY SUMMARY: Determination of the severity of autism spectrum disorder is based in part on expert (but subjective) clinician observations during the ADOS-2. Two characteristics of child vocalizations-a smaller number of speech-like sounds per vocalization and higher pitched vocalizations (including cries)-were associated with greater autism symptom severity. The results suggest that objectively ascertained characteristics of children's vocalizations capture variance in children's restricted and repetitive behaviors that are reflected in clinician severity indices.","The project described was supported in part by Grant Number UL1TR002736.

Parents of children with developmental disorders showed higher levels of parenting stress, depressive symptoms, and anxiety symptoms than did parents of children with typical development. Parenting stress and health worries were positively related to mental health symptoms. The association between having a child with developmental disorders and mental health symptoms was mediated by parenting stress.

However, a range of factors relating to children, parents and caregivers, and study design may impact on outcomes and thus the generalizability of these interventions to the broader community. The objective of this review was to examine factors that may influence the feasibility, appropriateness, effectiveness, and generalizability of parent mediated interventions for children with ASD. We conducted a systematic review, yielding 41 articles. There was substantial variability in the intervention type, intensity, and study quality. Notably, 46 different inclusion/exclusion criteria were reported across studies including factors relating to children's development, access to other services, comorbidities, parental factors, and access to the intervention. Fifteen articles included examination of 45 different factors potentially associated with, or influencing, intervention outcomes including child (e.g., language skills, ASD severity, cognition) and parent (e.g., adherence and fidelity, education) factors. Although there is clear evidence for an increasingly sophisticated (e.g., systematic phased research for some interventions) and diverse (e.g., studies in geographical diverse contexts including low-resource communities) approach to research examining parent mediated interventions, there remains a need for improved study quality and measurement consistency in research, including a detailed examination of factors that may predict, moderate, and mediate intervention effectiveness for children and their parents.

LAY SUMMARY: Parent mediated interventions-in which parents adapt their own behavior or deliver interventions to help their children learn-appear to be effective for some children with autism spectrum disorder. In this review, we identified a range of child, parent, and study design factors that may influence intervention outcomes and ultimately the uptake of these approaches in the community. We suggest that research in this area could be further improved by ensuring that studies include diverse groups of children and parents, and by using study designs that help to establish not only if interventions work, but for whom they work best and why.",This research was supported by research funding from Griffith University and Simon Fraser University.

At the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, all of these services came to a complete halt following strict lockdowns. Many services have resumed in a hybrid format using face to face and virtual modes of delivery. This study describes findings from the COVID-19 impact survey administered at the onset of the pandemic in a subgroup of families from the SPARK cohort (N = 6393), one of the largest ASD cohorts in the US. The differential early impact of COVID-19 on various subgroups of children with ASD and their families was examined. Caregivers of children and adolescents with ASD between 19 months and 18 years completed an online survey inquiring about the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on access to services, parent concerns about the same, impact on child's ASD-related behaviors, child, and parent mental health, and the benefits/potential benefits of online/future online services. Analysis revealed that certain demographic (age, income/SES) and child-related factors (repetitive behaviors, language, functional, cognitive, and motor impairments, and child's understanding), as well as parent's past mental health were associated with/predicted greater service disruptions, greater ASD-related behaviors, and greater negative impact on parent mental health. In conclusion, younger children, children from low-income families, and children with greater impairment severity (more severe repetitive behaviors, language, cognitive, function, language, and motor impairments) were more negatively impacted by the pandemic through service disruptions, increased ASD-related behaviors, parent health/family impact, and found online interactions to be less beneficial. LAY SUMMARY: The SPARK study impact survey shows that at the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, parents reported significant service disruptions, negative impact on their child's ASD-related behaviors as well as their own mental health; which was greater in families with younger children, children with greater ASD severity, and children from low-income families. Majority of families did not report significant benefits of online services whereas some families did. Low-income families were hopeful about receiving benefits through future online services. Overall, these findings have important implications for future clinical care delivery and healthcare policies to ensure that healthcare services are not interrupted during a potential resurgence of COVID-19 or other pandemics. A combination of in-person and online healthcare and family support services must be implemented to prevent negative health impacts in the future.","The author is grateful to all SPARK families, SPARK clinical sites, and SPARK staff and appreciates obtaining access to the phenotypic data on SFARI Base.

A systematic review and meta‐analysis”,"Individuals with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) tend to show distinctive, atypical acoustic patterns of speech. These behaviors affect social interactions and social development and could represent a non-invasive marker for ASD. We systematically reviewed the literature quantifying acoustic patterns in ASD. Search terms were: (prosody OR intonation OR inflection OR intensity OR pitch OR fundamental frequency OR speech rate OR voice quality OR acoustic) AND (autis* OR Asperger). Results were filtered to include only: empirical studies quantifying acoustic features of vocal production in ASD, with a sample size >2, and the inclusion of a neurotypical comparison group and/or correlations between acoustic measures and severity of clinical features. We identified 34 articles, including 30 univariate studies and 15 multivariate machine-learning studies. We performed meta-analyses of the univariate studies, identifying significant differences in mean pitch and pitch range between individuals with ASD and comparison participants (Cohen's d of 0.4-0.5 and discriminatory accuracy of about 61-64%). The multivariate studies reported higher accuracies than the univariate studies (63-96%). However, the methods used and the acoustic features investigated were too diverse for performing meta-analysis. We conclude that multivariate studies of acoustic patterns are a promising but yet unsystematic avenue for establishing ASD markers. We outline three recommendations for future studies: open data, open methods, and theory-driven research.

Multiple sources of evidence have suggested a neurophenotypic convergence of ASD-related characteristics and typical sex differences. Two existing, albeit competing, models provide predictions on such neurophenotypic convergence. These two models are testable with neuroimaging. Specifically, the Extreme Male Brain (EMB) model predicts that ASD is associated with enhanced brain maleness in both males and females with ASD (i.e., a shift-towards-maleness). In contrast, the Gender Incoherence (GI) model predicts a shift-towards-maleness in females, yet a shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD.MethodsTo clarify whether either model applies to the intrinsic functional properties of the brain in males with ASD, we measured the statistical overlap between typical sex differences and ASD-related atypicalities in resting-state fMRI (R-fMRI) datasets largely available in males. Main analyses focused on two large-scale R-fMRI samples: 357 neurotypical (NT) males and 471 NT females from the 1000 Functional Connectome Project and 360 males with ASD and 403 NT males from the Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange.ResultsAcross all R-fMRI metrics, results revealed coexisting, but network-specific, shift-towards-maleness and shift-towards-femaleness in males with ASD. A shift-towards-maleness mostly involved the default network, while a shift-towards-femaleness mostly occurred in the somatomotor network. Explorations of the associated cognitive processes using available cognitive ontology maps indicated that higher-order social cognitive functions corresponded to the shift-towards-maleness, while lower-order sensory motor processes corresponded to the shift-towards-femaleness.ConclusionsThe present findings suggest that atypical intrinsic brain properties in males with ASD partly reflect mechanisms involved in sexual differentiation. A model based on network-dependent atypical sex mosaicism can synthesize prior competing theories on factors involved in sex differentiation in ASD.","AcknowledegmentsWe acknowledge the data donors and organizers of the 1000 Functional Connectome Project (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/fcpClassic/FcpTable.html), Autism Brain Imaging Data Exchange I (http://fcon_1000.projects.nitrc.org/indi/abide), and Brain Genomics Superstruct Project (http://neuroinformatics.harvard.edu/gsp/) data repositories.

Evidence indicates an imbalance in the brain’s reward system responsiveness to social and non-social stimuli may contribute to both social deficits and RRBIs. Thus, this study’s central aim was to compare brain responsiveness to individual RRBI (i.e., circumscribed interests), with social rewards (i.e., social approval), in youth with ASD relative to typically developing controls (TDCs).MethodsWe conducted a 3T functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) study to investigate the blood-oxygenation-level-dependent effect of personalized circumscribed interest rewards versus social rewards in 39 youth with ASD relative to 22 TDC. To probe the reward system, we employed short video clips as reinforcement in an instrumental incentive delay task. This optimization increased the task’s ecological validity compared to still pictures that are often used in this line of research.ResultsCompared to TDCs, youth with ASD had stronger reward system responses for CIs mostly within the non-social realm (e.g., video games) than social rewards (e.g., approval). Additionally, this imbalance within the caudate nucleus’ responsiveness was related to greater social impairment.ConclusionsThe current data support the idea of reward system dysfunction that may contribute to enhanced motivation for RRBIs in ASD, accompanied by diminished motivation for social engagement. If a dysregulated reward system indeed supports the emergence and maintenance of social and non-social symptoms of ASD, then strategically targeting the reward system in future treatment endeavors may allow for more efficacious treatment practices that help improve outcomes for individuals with ASD and their families.",We thank the many youths and families for their participation in the study.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Adolescent; Autistic Disorder; Brain; Case-Control Studies; Child; Female; Humans; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Motivation; Reward; Social Behavior; Stereotyped Behavior,30/01/2018,2018,30/01/2018,2018-12,9,1,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Kohls, Gregor; Antezana, Ligia; Mosner, Maya G.; Schultz, Robert T.; Yerys, Benjamin E.","Kohls, Gregor (Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Psychosomatics and Psychotherapy, RWTH Aachen University, Aachen, Germany); Antezana, Ligia (Department of Psychology, Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University, Blacksburg, VA, USA); Mosner, Maya G.

Important deficits remain at adolescence in the adaptive abilities of children with Autism spectrum disorders, but changes in adaptive skills show two distinct growth rates. The univariate analysis reveals that low growth trajectories for both social and communication outcome are associated with the following characteristics at age 5: low cognitive and language skills, presence of epilepsy, and severity of autism. The multivariate analysis confirms that risk factors at age 5, were low language and severity of autism for both social and communication outcomes 10 years later, and that hours of early intervention was protective factor for communication.","This work was supported by grants from PHRC 1997 and 2006, and Orange Foundation, France.

However, little is known about the perceptual factors that influence target detection. The current study aimed to investigate disembedding in children with and without ASD, aged 8–15 years, using the newly developed, stimulus-controlled L-EFT, M-EFT and D-EFT. Firstly, results revealed superior disembedding for children with ASD, irrespective of the type of target or embedding context, although the ASD group took more time in both the M-EFT and D-EFT. Secondly, the number of target lines continuing into the context proved more of a hindrance for the controls. Taken together, these findings provide strong evidence to support the notion of superior disembedding in ASD.","The authors would like to thank all participants, their families, the Leuven Autism Research consortium and the Expertise Centre for Autism for their time and contribution to this research.

Because of the overwhelming focus on males, little is known about the neuroanatomical basis of sex differences in ASD. Investigations of sex differences with adequate sample sizes are critical for improving our understanding of the biological mechanisms underlying ASD in females.MethodsWe leveraged the open-access autism brain imaging data exchange (ABIDE) dataset to obtain structural brain imaging data from 53 females with ASD, who were matched with equivalent samples of males with ASD, and their typically developing (TD) male and female peers. Brain images were processed with FreeSurfer to assess three key features of local cortical morphometry: volume, thickness, and gyrification. A whole-brain approach was used to identify significant effects of sex, diagnosis, and sex-by-diagnosis interaction, using a stringent threshold of p < 0.01 to control for false positives. Stability and power analyses were conducted to guide future research on sex differences in ASD.ResultsWe detected a main effect of sex in the bilateral superior temporal cortex, driven by greater cortical volume in females compared to males in both the ASD and TD groups. Sex-by-diagnosis interaction was detected in the gyrification of the ventromedial/orbitofrontal prefrontal cortex (vmPFC/OFC). Post-hoc analyses revealed that sex-by-diagnosis interaction was driven by reduced vmPFC/OFC gyrification in males with ASD, compared to females with ASD as well as TD males and females. Finally, stability analyses demonstrated a dramatic drop in the likelihood of observing significant clusters as the sample size decreased, suggesting that previous studies have been largely underpowered. For instance, with a sample of 30 females with ASD (total n = 120), a significant sex-by-diagnosis interaction was only detected in 50 % of the simulated subsamples.ConclusionsOur results demonstrate that some features of typical sex differences are preserved in the brain of individuals with ASD, while others are not. Sex differences in ASD are associated with cortical regions involved in language and social function, two domains of deficits in the disorder. Stability analyses provide novel quantitative insights into why smaller samples may have previously failed to detect sex differences.","M.S. is supported by a fellowship from the Swiss National Foundation of Science (#145760).

College is an increasingly common context in which individuals learn and hone the necessary skills for adulthood. The goal of this paper is to systematically review and assess the existing research on college as a context of EA development in autistic individuals, particularly in terms of understanding whether and how this context might be critically different for those who are typically developing or developing with other disabilities. Our findings indicate that ASD college students report feeling prepared academically, but exhibit weaknesses in daily living and social skills. Interventions largely focus on social skills, and rarely evaluate outcomes relevant to college success or longer-term emerging adulthood independence. We conclude with hypotheses and recommendations for future work that are essential for understanding and supporting ASD students as they navigate potentially unique challenges in college and their transition to independence during EA.","C.M.

If these theories are correct, autistic children might be expected to demonstrate difficulties on linguistic tasks that rely on predictive processing. Previous research has largely focused on older autistic children and adolescents with average language and cognition. The present study used an eye-gaze task to evaluate predictive language processing among 3- to 4-year-old autistic children (n = 34) and 1.5- to 3-year-old, language-matched neurotypical (NT) children (n = 34). Children viewed images (e.g., a cake and a ball) and heard sentences with informative verbs (e.g., Eat the cake) or neutral verbs (e.g., Find the cake). Analyses of children's looking behaviors indicated that young autistic children, like their language-matched NT peers, engaged in predictive language processing. Regression results revealed a significant effect of diagnostic group, when statistically controlling for age differences. The NT group displayed larger difference scores between the informative and neutral verb conditions (in looks to target nouns) compared to the ASD group. Receptive language measures were predictive of looking behavior across time for both groups, such that children with stronger language skills were more efficient in making use of informative verbs to process upcoming information. Taken together, these results suggest that young autistic children can engage in predictive processing though further research is warranted to explore the developmental trajectory relative to NT development. LAY SUMMARY: This study found that 3- to 4-year-old autistic children and younger, language-matched neurotypical (NT) children both used verbs to predict upcoming nouns in sentences like ""Eat the cake."" For both autistic and NT children, those with stronger language skills were able to predict upcoming nouns more quickly.","We want to thank the children and families who participated in this study.

In contrast, other theories (e.g., the “top down control of imitation” hypothesis) state that the problem is not in imitation per se but in the way social cues modulate imitative responses. In this study, 15 high-functioning children with autism and 15 matched controls were tested for their ability to imitate finger movements preceded by neutral and emotional facial expressions (primes) in a stimulus–response compatibility task. Hand movements performed after neutral expressions did not differ between the two groups (i.e., they both showed a normal imitative tendency). However, hand movements performed after emotional expressions significantly differed between the two populations, with controls, but not autistic spectrum disorder (ASD), showing enhanced imitation in the emotional condition. This study supports the view that, in ASD, imitation abilities are spared but they are not modulated according to the emotional and social context.","PB was partly supported by the American Psychiatric Institute for Research and Education (APIRE), by the Italian Ministry for University and Research and by the Italian Ministry of Health (IRCCS “E.

This study aimed to ground this research field in an understanding of the perspectives of members of the autism community. Following focus groups to identify topics, an online survey was distributed to autistic adults, parents of children with autism and practitioners in health and education settings across 11 European countries. Survey respondents (n = 2317) were positively disposed towards early autism research, and there was significant overlap in their priorities for the field and preferred language to describe infant research participants. However, there were also differences including overall less favourable endorsement of early autism research by autistic adults relative to other groups and a dislike of the phrase 'at-risk' to describe infant participants, in all groups except healthcare practitioners. The findings overall indicate that the autism community in Europe is supportive of early autism research.

The aim of the study is to apply current screening and standardized diagnostic instruments to a Chinese population to establish a prevalence estimate of ASC in an undiagnosed population in mainland China. We followed the design development used previously in the UK published in 2009 by Baron-Cohen and colleagues. The Mandarin Childhood Autism Spectrum Test (CAST) was validated by screening primary school pupils (n = 737 children age 6-10 years old) in Beijing and by conducting diagnostic assessments using the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule and the Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised. The prevalence estimate was generated after adjusting and imputing for missing values using the inverse probability weighting. Response was high (97%). Using the UK cutoff (≥15), CAST performance has 84% sensitivity and 96% specificity (95% confidence interval [CI]: 46, 98, and 96, 97, respectively). Six out of 103 children, not previously diagnosed, were found to the meet diagnostic criteria (8.5 after adjustment, 95% CI: 1.6, 15.4). The preliminary prevalence in an undiagnosed primary school population in mainland China was 119 per 10,000 (95% CI: 53, 265). The utility of CAST is acceptable as a screening instrument for ASC in large epidemiological studies in China. Using a comparable method, the preliminary prevalence estimate of ASC in mainland China is similar to that of those from developed countries.","This study was funded by the Waterloo Foundation, Peking University First Hospital, Cambridge Institute of Public Health, and the Autism Research Trust.

This study explored whether the SPT effect exhibited by ASD children is caused by the movement component or by processing materials twice. More importantly, this study explored whether intelligence influences the SPT effect exhibited by ASD children. ASD children with three levels of intelligence (N = 56) and a control group, children with intellectual disability (ID) who had low intelligence but did not have ASD (N = 21), were asked to perform working memory tasks for instructions under VT, SPT and repeated (hearing the instruction twice) conditions. No significant difference in performance was observed between the VT and repeated conditions, regardless of the child's level of intelligence. ASD children with lower-middle intelligence exhibited a smaller SPT effect than ASD children with upper-middle intelligence. Critically, while ASD children with low intelligence did not exhibit the SPT effect, an ID group with equivalent low intelligence did show this effect. Therefore, these results show that the SPT effect for ASD children is caused by the movement component and is uniquely associated with a certain level of intelligence, namely, lower middle and higher levels of intelligence. LAY SUMMARY: In ASD children, the benefit of physically performing instructions for working memory performance is uniquely associated with a certain level of intelligence. Only ASD children with lower-middle intelligence (and higher) benefit from physically performing instructions, and higher intelligence increases this benefit; ASD children with low intelligence do not show this benefit. This benefit in ASD children is attributed to the additional motoric code generated by physical performance.","This work was supported by the MOE Layout Foundation of Humanities and Social Sciences (18YJA190016).

However, whether and how sensory processing is affected has not yet been considered in detail. Parents/caregivers of 38 children with a 16p11.2 deletion and 31 children with a 16p11.2 duplication completed the Sensory Behavior Questionnaire (SBQ) and the Child Sensory Profile 2 (CSP-2) along with other standardized questionnaires assessing autistic traits (SRS-2), ADHD traits (Conners 3), anxiety (SCAS-P) and adaptive behavior (VABS-3). SBQ and CSP-2 responses found that sensory processing differences were clearly evident in both 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication, though there was significant variation in both cohorts. SBQ data indicated the frequency and impact of sensory behavior were more severe when compared to neurotypical children, with levels being similar to autistic children. CSP-2 data indicated over 70% of children displayed clear differences in sensory registration (missing sensory input). Seventy-one percent with 16p11.2 duplications were also unusually sensitive to sensory information and 57% with 16p11.2 duplications were unusually avoidant of sensory stimuli. This first detailed assessment of sensory processing, alongside other clinical features, in relatively large cohorts of children with a 16p11.2 deletion and 16p11.2 duplication demonstrates that sensory processing differences have a profound impact on their lives.","This work was funded by The Children&#x27;s Hospital Charity, Sheffield Children&#x27;s Hospital grant number CA18002.

Here, we investigated this hypothesis by estimating learning rates (i.e. the speed with which one learns) in three different environments that differed in rule stability and uncertainty. We found that neurotypical participants with more autistic traits performed worse in a volatile environment (with unstable rules), as they chose less often for the most rewarding option. Exploratory analyses indicated that performance was specifically worse when reward rules were opposite to those initially learned for participants with more autistic traits. However, there were no differences in the adjustment of learning rates between participants with more versus less autistic traits. Together, these results suggest that performance in volatile environments is lower in participants with more autistic traits, but that this performance difference cannot be unambiguously explained by an impairment in adjusting learning rates.","The authors thank Lina Weinges for her help with data collection.

Our previous study demonstrated that TBR1, a causative gene of ASD, controls axonal projection and neuronal activation of amygdala and regulates social interaction and vocal communication in a mouse model. Behavioral defects caused by Tbr1 haploinsufficiency can be ameliorated by increasing neural activity via D-cycloserine treatment, an N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor (NMDAR) coagonist. In this report, we investigate the role of TBR1 in regulating olfaction and test whether D-cycloserine can also improve olfactory defects in Tbr1 mutant mice.MethodsWe used Tbr1+/− mice as a model to investigate the function of TBR1 in olfactory sensation and discrimination of non-social odors. We employed a behavioral assay to characterize the olfactory defects of Tbr1+/− mice. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and histological analysis were applied to characterize anatomical features. Immunostaining was performed to further analyze differences in expression of TBR1 subfamily members (namely TBR1, TBR2, and TBX21), interneuron populations, and dendritic abnormalities in olfactory bulbs. Finally, C-FOS staining was used to monitor neuronal activation of the olfactory system upon odor stimulation.ResultsTbr1+/− mice exhibited smaller olfactory bulbs and anterior commissures, reduced interneuron populations, and an abnormal dendritic morphology of mitral cells in the olfactory bulbs. Tbr1 haploinsufficiency specifically impaired olfactory discrimination but not olfactory sensation. Neuronal activation upon odorant stimulation was reduced in the glomerular layer of Tbr1+/− olfactory bulbs. Furthermore, although the sizes of piriform and perirhinal cortices were not affected by Tbr1 deficiency, neuronal activation was reduced in these two cortical regions in response to odorant stimulation. These results suggest an impairment of neuronal activation in olfactory bulbs and defective connectivity from olfactory bulbs to the upper olfactory system in Tbr1+/− mice. Systemic administration of D-cycloserine, an NMDAR co-agonist, ameliorated olfactory discrimination in Tbr1+/− mice, suggesting that increased neuronal activity has a beneficial effect on Tbr1 deficiency.ConclusionsTbr1 regulates neural circuits and activity in the olfactory system to control olfaction. Tbr1+/− mice can serve as a suitable model for revealing how an autism causative gene controls neuronal circuits, neural activity, and autism-related behaviors.","We thank the Animal Facility of the Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, for excellent technical assistance, Dr. John O’Brien for English editing, and members of Dr. Yi-Ping Hsueh’s laboratory for relabeling samples for blind experiments.",Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Animals; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Cycloserine; DNA-Binding Proteins; Discrimination, Psychological; Haploinsufficiency; Male; Mice; Mice, Inbred C57BL; Neurons; Olfactory Bulb; Olfactory Perception; Receptors, N-Methyl-D-Aspartate; Smell; T-Box Domain Proteins",11/02/2019,2019,11/02/2019,2019-12,10,1,5,All OA; Gold,Article,"Huang, Tzyy-Nan; Yen, Tzu-Li; Qiu, Lily R.; Chuang, Hsiu-Chun; Lerch, Jason P.; Hsueh, Yi-Ping","Huang, Tzyy-Nan (Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, 128, Academia Rd., Sec. 2, 11529, Taipei, Taiwan); Yen, Tzu-Li (Institute of Molecular Biology, Academia Sinica, 128, Academia Rd., Sec. 2, 11529, Taipei, Taiwan); Qiu, Lily R.

We used functional magnetic resonance imaging and a visuo-spatial 1-back task with four levels of difficulty. A total of 14 children with autism spectrum disorder and 15 typically developing children (ages 7-13) were included at baseline and followed up approximately 2 years later. Despite similar task performance between groups, differences were evident in the developmental trajectories of neural responses. Typically developing children showed greater load-dependent activation which intensified over time in the frontal, parietal and occipital lobes and the right fusiform gyrus, compared to those with autism spectrum disorder. Children with autism spectrum disorder showed minimal age-related changes in load-dependent activation, but greater longitudinal load-dependent deactivation in default mode network compared to typically developing children. Results suggest inadequate modulation of neural activity with increasing cognitive demands in children with autism spectrum disorder, which does not mature into adolescence, unlike their typically developing peers. Diminished ability for children with autism spectrum disorder to modulate neural activity during this period of maturation suggests that they may be more vulnerable to the increasing complexity of social and academic demands as they progress through adolescence than their peers.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005","Adolescent; Age Factors; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Child; Child Development; Female; Humans; Longitudinal Studies; Magnetic Resonance Imaging; Male; Memory, Short-Term; Space Perception; Visual Perception",29/03/2018,2018,29/03/2018,2019-04,23,3,639-652,Closed,Article,"Vogan, Vanessa M; Morgan, Benjamin R; Smith, Mary Lou; Taylor, Margot J","Vogan, Vanessa M (University of Toronto, Canada); Morgan, Benjamin R (University of Toronto, Canada); Smith, Mary Lou (University of Toronto, Canada); Taylor, Margot J (University of Toronto, Canada)","Vogan, Vanessa M (University of Toronto)","Vogan, Vanessa M (University of Toronto); Morgan, Benjamin R (University of Toronto); Smith, Mary Lou (University of Toronto); Taylor, Margot J (University of Toronto)",University of Toronto,grid.17063.33,Canada,Canadian Institutes of Health Research,9,4,0.93,2,,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1101851444,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,

Precocious amygdala development is commonly reported in ASD youth with the degree of overgrowth positively correlated to the severity of ASD symptoms. Prenatal exposure to VPA leads to an ASD phenotype in both humans and rats and has become a commonly used tool to model the complexity of ASD symptoms in the laboratory. Here, we examined abnormalities in gene expression in the amygdala and socioemotional behavior across development in the valproic acid (VPA) rat model of ASD.MethodsRat dams received oral gavage of VPA (500 mg/kg) or saline daily between E11 and 13. Socioemotional behavior was tracked across development in both sexes. RNA sequencing and proteomics were performed on amygdala samples from male rats across development.ResultsEffects of VPA on time spent in social proximity and anxiety-like behavior were sex dependent, with social abnormalities presenting in males and heightened anxiety in females. Across time VPA stunted developmental and immune, but enhanced cellular death and disorder, pathways in the amygdala relative to saline controls. At postnatal day 10, gene pathways involved in nervous system and cellular development displayed predicted activations in prenatally exposed VPA amygdala samples. By juvenile age, however, transcriptomic and proteomic pathways displayed reductions in cellular growth and neural development. Alterations in immune pathways, calcium signaling, Rho GTPases, and protein kinase A signaling were also observed.ConclusionsAs behavioral, developmental, and genomic alterations are similar to those reported in ASD, these results lend support to prenatal exposure to VPA as a useful tool for understanding how developmental insults to molecular pathways in the amygdala give rise to ASD-related syndromes.","We are thankful to Gregory Tharp and Nirav Patel at the Yerkes Nonhuman Primate Genomics Core and to Duc Duong at the Emory Integrated Proteomics Core for carrying out RNA sequencing, LC-MS/MS, and assisting with statistical analyses.

We reconsider whether executive function (EF) accounts of RRBs should be revisited. EF deficits and high levels of RRBs are often pronounced in individuals with ASD and are also prevalent in young typically developing children. Despite this, the evidence is mixed, and there has been no systematic attempt to evaluate the relationship across studies and between task batteries. We examine recent evidence, and in three highly powered random-effects analyses (N = 2964), examine the strength of the association between RRB levels and performance on set shifting, inhibitory control, and parental-report based EF batteries. The analyses confirm significant associations between high levels of the behaviors and poor EF skills. Moreover, the associations remained stable across typical development and in individuals with ASD and across different types of EF measures. These meta-analyses consolidate recent evidence identifying that cognitive mechanisms correlate with high RRBs that are seen in individuals with ASD, as well as in typical development. We propose that the EF account may be critical for guiding future interventions in ASD research. LAY SUMMARY: Restricted and repetitive behaviors (RRBs) are diagnostic criteria for Autism yet also common in typical development, and if they persist over time some can have a negative impact on learning and social acceptance. The present meta-analyses found that high levels of RRBs related to poor performance on set-shifting and inhibitory control tasks, as well as high ratings on parental report scales. Future studies should create interventions that aim to improve these skills as they may help manage challenging RRBs.",,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Cognition; Executive Function; Humans; Meta-Analysis as Topic; Parents,06/01/2021,2021,06/01/2021,2021-06,14,6,1163-1185,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Iversen, Rebecca Kvisler; Lewis, Charlie","Iversen, Rebecca Kvisler (Fylde College, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK); Lewis, Charlie (Fylde College, Department of Psychology, Faculty of Science and Technology, Lancaster University, Lancaster, UK)","Iversen, Rebecca Kvisler (Lancaster University)","Iversen, Rebecca Kvisler (Lancaster University); Lewis, Charlie (Lancaster University)",Lancaster University,grid.9835.7,United Kingdom,,10,10,,,12,https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/pdfdirect/10.1002/aur.2468,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134389558,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,

We wanted to help people understand autism. Most autism trainings are not made by autistic people. Autistic people know what it is like to be autistic. So autistic people may be the best teachers when it comes to teaching about autism. Autistic students and non-autistic professors made an autism training. The students made videos for the training. They also helped make questions to see what people learned from the trainings. Professors who are not autistic made a training on their own. Students in New York City tried out the trainings. After they answered questions, they did either the training the autistic students helped make or the training made by only professors. Then, they answered questions again. We learned from the students how to make our trainings better. Then, students from two universities in the United States and one university in Lebanon did our trainings and questions. Both trainings made hidden feelings about autism better. The training autistic students helped make taught students more than the training professors made on their own. The autistic-led training also helped students accept autism more. These studies show that autistic students can make autism research and trainings better.

The new Autism Diagnostic Interview-Revised algorithms (research cutoff) gave excellent specificities (91%-96%) but low sensitivities (44%-52%). Applying adjusted cutoffs (lower than recommended based on receiver operating characteristics) yielded a better balance between sensitivity (77%-82%) and specificity (60%-62%). Findings for the Autism Diagnostic Observation Schedule were consistent with previous studies showing high sensitivity (94%-100%) and alongside lower specificity (52%-76%) when using the autism spectrum cutoff, but better balanced sensitivity (81%-94%) and specificity (81%-83%) when using the autism cutoff.

Experimental work in animals indicates that this link is mediated by maternal immune activation (MIA) involving interactions between cytokine-associated inflammatory events, oxidative stress, and other pathophysiological processes such as hypoferremia and zinc deficiency. Maternal administration of the viral mimic polyriboinosinic-polyribocytidylic acid (poly(I:C)) in mice produces several behavioral phenotypes in adult offspring of relevance to autism spectrum disorder (ASD) and other neurodevelopmental disorders.MethodsHere, we investigated whether some of these phenotypes might also present in juveniles. In addition, given the known immunomodulatory and neuroprotective effects of vitamin D, we also investigated whether the co-administration of vitamin D could block MIA-induced ASD-related behaviors. We co-administered the hormonally active form of vitamin D, 1α,25 dihydroxy vitamin D3 (1,25OHD), simultaneously with poly(I:C) and examined (i) social interaction, stereotyped behavior, emotional learning and memory, and innate anxiety-like behavior in juveniles and (ii) the levels of the pro-inflammatory cytokines IL-1β, IL-6 and TNF-α in maternal plasma and fetal brains.ResultsWe show that like adult offspring that were exposed to MIA, juveniles display similar deficits in social approach behavior. Juvenile MIA offspring also show abnormal stereotyped digging and impaired acquisition and expression of tone-cued fear conditioning. Importantly, our study reveals that prenatal administration of 1,25OHD abolishes all these behavioral deficits in poly(I:C)-treated juveniles. However, prenatal administration of vitamin D had no effect on pro-inflammatory cytokine levels in dams or in fetal brains suggesting the anti-inflammatory actions of vitamin D are not the critical mechanism for its preventive actions in this ASD animal model.ConclusionsThis work raises the possibility that early dietary supplementation with vitamin D may open new avenues for a successful attenuation or even prevention of neurodevelopmental disorders following maternal inflammation during pregnancy.",Not applicable.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,"Animals; Behavior, Animal; Child Development Disorders, Pervasive; Cytokines; Disease Models, Animal; Female; Humans; Mice; Phenotype; Poly I-C; Polynucleotides; Pregnancy; Prenatal Exposure Delayed Effects; Social Behavior; Stereotyped Behavior; Vitamin D",07/03/2017,2017,07/03/2017,2017-12,8,1,9,All OA; Gold,Article,"Vuillermot, Stephanie; Luan, Wei; Meyer, Urs; Eyles, Darryl","Vuillermot, Stephanie (Swiss Federal Institute of Technology (ETH) Zurich, 8603, Schwerzenbach, Switzerland); Luan, Wei (Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, 4072, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia); Meyer, Urs (Institute of Pharmacology and Toxicology, University of Zurich-Vetsuisse, Zurich, Switzerland); Eyles, Darryl (Queensland Brain Institute, The University of Queensland, 4072, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia; Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research, 4076, Brisbane, Queensland, Australia)","Eyles, Darryl (University of Queensland; Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research)","Vuillermot, Stephanie (ETH Zurich); Luan, Wei (University of Queensland); Meyer, Urs (University of Zurich); Eyles, Darryl (University of Queensland; Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research)",Queensland Centre for Mental Health Research; University of Zurich; University of Queensland; ETH Zurich,grid.466965.e; grid.7400.3; grid.1003.2; grid.5801.c,Australia; Switzerland; Australia; Switzerland,Swiss National Science Foundation; National Health and Medical Research Council,71,26,4.05,14.71,375,https://doi.org/10.1186/s13229-017-0125-0,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1084252368,52 Psychology; 5202 Biological Psychology,,No,,,

Using data from the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED), a multi-site case-control study of children born 2003-2006 in the United States, we examined the role of family history of autoimmune diseases, asthma, and allergies in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) as well as other developmental disorders (DD). We investigated maternal immune conditions during the pregnancy period, as well as lifetime history of these conditions in several family members (mother, father, siblings, and study child). Logistic regression analyses included 663 children with ASD, 984 children with DD, and 915 controls ascertained from the general population (POP). Maternal history of eczema/psoriasis and asthma was associated with a 20%-40% increased odds of both ASD and DD. Risk estimates varied by specific ASD subphenotypes in association with these exposures. In addition, children with ASD were more likely to have a history of psoriasis/eczema or allergies than POP controls. No association was observed for paternal history or family history of these immune conditions for either ASD or DD. These data support a link between maternal and child immune conditions and adverse neurodevelopmental outcomes, and further suggest that associations may differ by ASD phenotype of the child.

This study compared sibling adjustment and relationships in siblings of children with Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD-Sibs; n = 69) and siblings of children with typical development (TD-Sibs; n = 93). ASD-Sibs and TD-Sibs demonstrated similar emotional/behavioral adjustment. Older male ASD-Sibs were at increased risk for difficulties. Sibling relationships of ASD-Sibs involved less aggression, less involvement, and more avoidance than those of TD-Sibs. Partial support for a diathesis–stress conceptualization of sibling difficulties was found for ASD-Sibs. For TD-Sibs, broader autism phenotype (BAP) was related to psychosocial difficulties regardless of family stressors. For ASD-Sibs, BAP was related to difficulties only when family stressors were present. This suggests that having a sibling with ASD may be a protective factor that attenuates the negative impact of sibling BAP.",,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Child; Child, Preschool; Emotional Adjustment; Female; Humans; Male; Protective Factors; Sibling Relations; Siblings",07/04/2015,2015,07/04/2015,2015-09,45,9,2764-2778,Closed,Article,"Walton, Katherine M.; Ingersoll, Brooke R.","Walton, Katherine M.

The temporal structure of dyadic vocal interactions emerges from the rhythm, timing, and frequency of each individuals' vocalizations and reflects how the dyad dynamically organizes and adapts during an interaction. This study investigated the temporal structure of vocal interactions longitudinally in parent-child dyads of typically developing (TD) infants (n = 49; 9-18 months; 48% male) and toddlers with ASD (n = 23; 27.2 ± 5.0 months; 91.3% male) to identify how developing language and social skills impact the temporal dynamics of the interaction. Acoustic hierarchical temporal structure (HTS), a measure of the nested clustering of acoustic events across multiple timescales, was measured in free play interactions using Allan Factor. HTS reflects a signal's temporal complexity and variability, with greater HTS indicating reduced flexibility of the dyadic system. Child expressive language significantly predicted HTS (ß = -0.2) longitudinally across TD infants, with greater dyadic HTS associated with lower child language skills. ASD dyads exhibited greater HTS (i.e., more rigid temporal structure) than nonverbal matched (d = 0.41) and expressive language matched TD dyads (d = 0.28). Increased HTS in ASD dyads occurred at timescales >1 s, suggesting greater structuring of pragmatic aspects of interaction. Results provide a new window into how language development and social reciprocity serve as constraints to shape parent-child interaction dynamics and showcase a novel automated approach to characterizing vocal interactions across multiple timescales during early childhood.","We would like to thank all of our participating families for their contribution to this project.

We examined metacognitive awareness of face emotion recognition responses in autistic (N = 63) and non-autistic (N = 67) adults across (a) static, dynamic and social face emotion stimuli, (b) free- and forced-report response formats, and (c) four different sets of the six ""basic"" and six ""complex"" emotions. Within-individual relationships between recognition accuracy and post-recognition confidence provided no indication that autistic individuals were poorer at discriminating correct from incorrect recognition responses than non-autistic individuals, although both groups exhibited marked inter-individual variability. Although the autistic group was less accurate and slower to recognize emotions, confidence-accuracy calibration analyses provided no evidence of reduced sensitivity on their part to fluctuations in their emotion recognition performance. Across variations in stimulus type, response format and emotion, increases in accuracy were associated with progressively higher confidence, with similar calibration curves for both groups. Calibration curves for both groups were, however, characterized by overconfidence at the higher confidence levels (i.e., overall accuracy less than the average confidence level), with the non-autistic group contributing more decisions with 90%-100% confidence. Comparisons of slow and fast responders provided no evidence of a ""hard-easy"" effect-the tendency to exhibit overconfidence during hard tasks and underconfidence during easy tasks-suggesting that autistic individuals' slower recognition responding may reflect a strategic difference rather than a processing speed limitation. LAY SUMMARY: It is generally considered that autistic individuals may have difficulty recognizing other people's facial emotions. However, little is known about their awareness of any emotion recognition difficulties they may experience. This study indicates that, although there is considerable individual variability, autistic adults were as sensitive to variations in the accuracy of their recognition of others' emotions as their non-autistic peers.",This research was supported by ARC DP190100162 and the Hamish Ramsay Fund.

We examined neonatal vitamin D in relation to the child's later diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) or developmental delay (DD). Children aged 24-60 months enrolled in the population-based CHARGE case-control study were evaluated clinically for ASD (n = 357), DD (n = 134), or typical development (TD, n = 234) at the MIND Institute (Sacramento, CA) using standardized assessments. Total 25-hydroxyvitamin D (25[OH]D) was measured using sensitive isotope dilution liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry in archived dried blood spots collected for the California Department of Public Health's Newborn Screening Program. Multinomial logistic regression was used to calculate ORs as measures of the associations between 25 nmol/L change in 25(OH)D and ASD and DD. Associations between 25(OH)D and scores on Mullen Scales of Early Learning and Vineland Adaptive Behavior Scales were assessed using robust linear regression. Effect modification was examined using stratified models and interaction product terms. Unadjusted mean (SD) 25(OH)D was lower for DD (73.2 [37.6]) than for TD (82.7 [39.3]) and ASD (80.1 [37.4]). After adjustment for maternal prepregnancy body mass index and education, a 25 nmol/L increase in total 25(OH)D was not associated with ASD (OR = 0.97; CI: 0.87-1.08) or DD (OR = 0.91; 95% CI: 0.78-1.06). Neonatal 25(OH)D was associated with significantly reduced ASD only in females (adjusted OR = 0.74; 95% CI: 0.55-0.99, Pinteraction  = 0.03), and significantly reduced DD only in non-Hispanic white children (adjusted OR = 0.79; 95% CI: 0.63-0.98, Pinteraction  = 0.11 for Hispanic, Pinteraction  = 0.31 for other), driven by DD children with trisomy 21.

Epigenome-wide association studies (EWAS) in autism spectrum disorder (ASD) may shed light on particular biological mechanisms. However, studies of ASD cases versus controls have been limited by post-mortem timing and severely small sample sizes. Reports from in-life sampling of blood or saliva have also been very limited in sample size and/or genomic coverage. We present the largest case-control EWAS for ASD to date, combining data from population-based case-control and case-sibling pair studies.MethodsDNA from 968 blood samples from children in the Study to Explore Early Development (SEED 1) was used to generate epigenome-wide array DNA methylation (DNAm) data at 485,512 CpG sites for 453 cases and 515 controls, using the Illumina 450K Beadchip. The Simons Simplex Collection (SSC) provided 450K array DNAm data on an additional 343 cases and their unaffected siblings. We performed EWAS meta-analysis across results from the two data sets, with adjustment for sex and surrogate variables that reflect major sources of biological variation and technical confounding such as cell type, batch, and ancestry. We compared top EWAS results to those from a previous brain-based analysis. We also tested for enrichment of ASD EWAS CpGs for being targets of meQTL associations using available SNP genotype data in the SEED sample.FindingsIn this meta-analysis of blood-based DNA from 796 cases and 858 controls, no single CpG met a Bonferroni discovery threshold of p < 1.12 × 10− 7. Seven CpGs showed differences at p < 1 × 10− 5 and 48 at 1 × 10− 4. Of the top 7, 5 showed brain-based ASD associations as well, often with larger effect sizes, and the top 48 overall showed modest concordance (r = 0.31) in direction of effect with cerebellum samples. Finally, we observed suggestive evidence for enrichment of CpG sites controlled by SNPs (meQTL targets) among the EWAS CpG hits, which was consistent across EWAS and meQTL discovery p value thresholds.ConclusionsNo single CpG site showed a large enough DNAm difference between cases and controls to achieve epigenome-wide significance in this sample size. However, our results suggest the potential to observe disease associations from blood-based samples. Among the seven sites achieving suggestive statistical significance, we observed consistent, and stronger, effects at the same sites among brain samples. Discovery-oriented EWAS for ASD using blood samples will likely need even larger samples and unified genetic data to further understand DNAm differences in ASD.","FundingThis project was supported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) Cooperative Agreements announced under the following RFAs: 01086, 02199, DD11-002, DD06-003, DD04-001, and DD09-002.

Here we suggest a third route—disruption of the germline epigenome induced by exogenous toxicants during a parent’s gamete development. Similar to cases of germline mutation, these molecular perturbations may produce dysregulated transcription of brain-related genes during fetal and early development, resulting in abnormal neurobehavioral phenotypes in offspring. Many types of exposures may have these impacts, and here we discuss examples of anesthetic gases, tobacco components, synthetic steroids, and valproic acid. Alterations in parental germline could help explain some unsolved phenomena of autism, including increased prevalence, missing heritability, skewed sex ratio, and heterogeneity of neurobiology and behavior.",,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Anesthetics, Inhalation; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Germ Cells; Humans; Valproic Acid",01/10/2021,2021,01/10/2021,2022-10,52,10,4608-4624,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Escher, Jill; Yan, Wei; Rissman, Emilie F.; Wang, Hsiao-Lin V.; Hernandez, Arturo; Corces, Victor G.","Escher, Jill (Escher Fund for Autism, 1590 Calaveras Avenue, San Jose, CA, USA); Yan, Wei (The Lundquist Institute for Biomedical Innovation at Harbor-UCLA Medical Center, Torrance, CA, USA; Department of Medicine, David Geffen School of Medicine at UCLA, Los Angeles, CA, USA); Rissman, Emilie F.

598,690,pub.1145815208,10.1002/aur.2693,35199482,PMC9167260,,Conversational adaptation in children and teens with autism: Differences in talkativeness across contexts,"Successful social communication is complex; it relies on effectively deploying and continuously revising one's behavior to fit the needs of a given conversation, partner, and context. For example, a skilled conversationalist may instinctively become less talkative with a quiet partner and more talkative with a chattier one. Prior research suggests that behavioral flexibility across social contexts can be a particular challenge for individuals with autism spectrum condition (ASC), and that difficulty adapting to the changing needs of a conversation contributes to communicative breakdowns and poor social outcomes. In this study, we examine whether reduced conversational adaptation, as measured by talkativeness, differentiates 48 verbally fluent children and teens with ASC from 50 neurotypical (NT) peers matched on age, intelligence quotient, and sex ratio. Participants completed the Contextual Assessment of Social Skills with two novel conversation partners. The first acted interested in the conversation and talked more (Interested condition), while the second acted bored and talked less (Bored condition). Results revealed that NT participants emulated their conversation partner's behavior by being more talkative in the Interested condition as compared to the Bored condition (z = 9.92, p < 0.001). In contrast, the ASC group did not differentially adapt their behavior to the Bored versus Interested context, instead remaining consistently talkative in both (p = 0.88). The results of this study have implications for understanding social communication and behavioral adaptation in ASC, and may be valuable for clinicians interested in improving conversational competence in verbally fluent individuals with autism. LAY SUMMARY: Social communication-including everyday conversations-can be challenging for individuals on the autism spectrum. In successful conversations, people tend to adjust aspects of their language to be more similar to their partners'. In this study, we found that children and teens with autism did not change their own talkativeness in response to a social partner who was more or less talkative, whereas neurotypical peers did. These findings have clinical implications for improving conversational competence in verbally fluent individuals with autism.","We thank the children and families who participated in this study, as well as students, interns, volunteers, postdocs, clinicians, and administrative staff at the Center for Autism Research.",Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Adolescent; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Child; Communication; Humans; Language; Social Skills,24/02/2022,2022,24/02/2022,2022-06,15,6,1090-1108,Closed,Article,"Cola, Meredith; Zampella, Casey J.; Yankowitz, Lisa D.; Plate, Samantha; Petrulla, Victoria; Tena, Kimberly; Russell, Alison; Pandey, Juhi; Schultz, Robert T.; Parish‐Morris, Julia","Cola, Meredith (Center for Autism Research, Children's Hospital of Philadelphia, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA; Department of Psychology, La Salle University, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, USA); Zampella, Casey J.

Studies exploring brain dynamics to comprehensively characterize and link connectivity to large-scale cortical networks and clinical symptoms are lagging considerably. Patterns of neural coherence within the Default Mode Network (DMN) and Salience Network (SN) during resting state were investigated in 12 children with ASD (MAge  = 9.2) and 13 age and gender-matched neurotypicals (NT) (MAge  = 9.3) with magnetoencephalography. Coherence between 231 brain region pairs within four frequency bands (theta (4-7 Hz), alpha, (8-12 Hz), beta (13-30 Hz), and gamma (30-80 Hz)) was calculated. Relationships between neural coherence and social functioning were examined. ASD was characterized by lower synchronization across all frequencies, reaching clinical significance in the gamma band. Lower gamma synchrony between fronto-temporo-parietal regions was observed, partially consistent with diminished default mode network (DMN) connectivity. Lower gamma coherence in ASD was evident in cross-hemispheric connections between: angular with inferior/middle frontal; middle temporal with middle/inferior frontal; and within right-hemispheric connections between angular, middle temporal, and inferior/middle frontal cortices. Lower gamma coherence between left angular and left superior frontal, right inferior/middle frontal, and right precuneus and between right angular and inferior/middle frontal cortices was related to lower social/social-communication functioning. Results suggest a pattern of lower gamma band coherence in a subset of regions within the DMN in ASD (angular and middle temporal cortical areas) related to lower social/social-communicative functioning.

LAY SUMMARY: Communication between different areas of the brain was observed in children with ASD and neurotypical children while awake, but not working on a task. Magnetoencephalography was used to measure tiny magnetic fields naturally generated via brain activity. The brains of children with ASD showed less communication between areas that are important for social information processing compared to the brains of neurotypical children. The amount of communication between these areas was associated with social and social communication difficulties.",This work was supported by University of Michigan through grant number U029070.,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Brain; Child; Female; Humans; Magnetoencephalography; Male; Neural Pathways,18/12/2017,2017,18/12/2017,2018-03,11,3,434-449,All OA; Green,Article,"Lajiness‐O'Neill, Renée; Brennan, Jonathan R.; Moran, John E.; Richard, Annette E.; Flores, Ana‐Mercedes; Swick, Casey; Goodcase, Ryan; Andersen, Tiffany; McFarlane, Kaitlyn; Rusiniak, Kenneth; Kovelman, Ioulia; Wagley, Neelima; Ugolini, Maggie; Albright, Jeremy; Bowyer, Susan M","Lajiness‐O'Neill, Renée (Eastern Michigan University, Ypsilanti, Michigan; Center for Human Growth and Development, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, Michigan); Brennan, Jonathan R.

Adapted cognitive behavior therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults with autism spectrum disorder has not previously been evaluated outside the United Kingdom. In this study, 19 adults with obsessive-compulsive disorder and autism spectrum disorder were treated using an adapted cognitive behavior therapy protocol that consisted of 20 sessions focused on exposure with response prevention. The primary outcome was the clinician-rated Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale. Participants were assessed up to 3 months after treatment. There were significant reductions on the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale at post-treatment (d = 1.5), and improvements were sustained at follow-up (d = 1.2). Self-rated obsessive-compulsive disorder and depressive symptoms showed statistically significant reductions. Improvements in general functioning and quality of life were statistically non-significant. Three participants (16%) were responders at post-treatment and four (21%) were in remission from obsessive-compulsive disorder. At follow-up, three participants (16%) were responders and one (5%) was in full remission. Adapted cognitive behavior therapy for obsessive-compulsive disorder in adults with co-occurring autism spectrum disorder is associated with reductions in obsessive-compulsive symptoms and depressive symptoms. However, outcomes are modest; few patients were completely symptom free, and treatment engagement was low with few completed exposures and low adherence to homework assignments.

This study aimed to systematically review evidence-based toilet training interventions for children on the autism spectrum, and assess the quality of existing evidence. Method Guided by the PRISMA statement, a search of scholarly databases was conducted and the study characteristics, methodological quality and intervention components of included studies were examined. Results This systematic review identified 26 studies that evaluated toilet training interventions for children on the autism spectrum. Results identified that while Azrin and Foxx’s (1971) Rapid Toilet Training approach is most widely researched for children on the autism spectrum, investigating the effects of current toilet training approaches is limited by small sample sizes, low-level study designs and variable methods of reporting outcomes. Conclusion Greater consideration of parent-child communication, children’s developmental and toileting skill level may facilitate development of toileting approaches that better meet the needs of children on the autism spectrum and their families.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2022-11,2022,,2022-11,99,,102049,Closed,Article,"Simon, Megan; Wilkes-Gillan, Sarah; Chen, Yu-Wei Ryan; Cordier, Reinie; Cantrill, Alycia; Parsons, Lauren; Phua, Jia Jun","Simon, Megan (); Wilkes-Gillan, Sarah (); Chen, Yu-Wei Ryan (); Cordier, Reinie (); Cantrill, Alycia (); Parsons, Lauren (); Phua, Jia Jun ()",,"Simon, Megan (); Wilkes-Gillan, Sarah (); Chen, Yu-Wei Ryan (); Cordier, Reinie (); Cantrill, Alycia (); Parsons, Lauren (); Phua, Jia Jun ()",,,,,0,0,,,7,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1151985165,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,,Yes,https://www.crd.york.ac.uk/prospero/display_record.php?RecordID=142891,Systematic Review,

This is perhaps a reflection of the different tasks that have been used. Children with autism (CWA) and typically developing controls, matched for verbal and non-verbal mental age, completed three tasks of inhibition, each representing different inhibitory subcomponents: Go/No-Go (delay inhibition), Dog-Pig Stroop (conflict inhibition), and a Flanker task (resistance to distractor inhibition). Behavioural ratings of inattention and hyperactivity/impulsivity were also obtained, as a possible source of heterogeneity in inhibitory ability. CWA were only impaired on the conflict inhibition task, suggesting that inhibitory difficulty is not a core executive deficit in autism. Symptoms of inattention were related to conflict task performance, and thus may be an important predictor of inhibitory heterogeneity.",,Journal of Autism and Developmental Disorders,,"0162-3257, 1573-3432","Attention; Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autistic Disorder; Child; Executive Function; Female; Humans; Inhibition, Psychological; Male; Neuropsychological Tests; Psychomotor Performance; Reaction Time",09/10/2012,2012,09/10/2012,2013-05,43,5,1065-1079,Closed,Article,"Sanderson, Charlotte; Allen, Melissa L.","Sanderson, Charlotte (Department of Psychology, Lancaster University, Lancashire, UK; Behavioural and Brain Sciences Unit, University College London (UCL) Institute of Child Health, 30 Guilford Street, WC1N 1EH, London, UK); Allen, Melissa L.

Friendships and connectedness may be important to autistic people and beneficial for their wellbeing. Our research aimed to understand the autistic community by interviewing 20 autistic people about their experiences of being connected to other autistic people. Participants were interviewed in person, over video, using a text-based software to type or over email. Participants detailed three parts of autistic community connectedness: a sense of belonging, social connection with autistic friends and political connectedness. The friendships autistic people had with one another were deemed to be very important to participants because it gave them confidence, provided companionship and made them happy. Some participants did not experience connectedness to the autistic community. These participants also found autism to be less important to their identity and had fewer positive feelings about being autistic. This research is important as it raises awareness that community connectedness is viewed as important to this group. It is possible that community connectedness may help protect the mental health of autistic people when they face stigma or negative life experiences in society.",The authors acknowledge Patrice Rusconi and Eilidh Cage.,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Humans; Autistic Disorder; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Friends; Mental Health; Interpersonal Relations,23/03/2022,2022,23/03/2022,2022-11,26,8,2151-2164,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Botha, Monique; Dibb, Bridget; Frost, David M","Botha, Monique (University of Stirling, UK); Dibb, Bridget (University of Surrey, UK); Frost, David M (University College London, UK)","Botha, Monique (University of Stirling)","Botha, Monique (University of Stirling); Dibb, Bridget (University of Surrey); Frost, David M (University College London)",University College London; University of Surrey; University of Stirling,grid.83440.3b; grid.5475.3; grid.11918.30,United Kingdom; United Kingdom; United Kingdom,Economic and Social Research Council,3,3,,,51,https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/13623613221080248,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1146508503,32 Biomedical and Clinical Sciences; 52 Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,No,,,

A significant overlap of genes and biological processes between both diseases has also been reported.MethodsHere, for the first time, we compared the gene expression profiles of ASD frontal cortex tissues and 22 cancer types obtained by differential expression meta-analysis and report gene, pathway, and drug set-based overlaps between them.ResultsFour cancer types (brain, thyroid, kidney, and pancreatic cancers) presented a significant overlap in gene expression deregulations in the same direction as ASD whereas two cancer types (lung and prostate cancers) showed differential expression profiles significantly deregulated in the opposite direction from ASD. Functional enrichment and LINCS L1000 based drug set enrichment analyses revealed the implication of several biological processes and pathways that were affected jointly in both diseases, including impairments of the immune system, and impairments in oxidative phosphorylation and ATP synthesis among others. Our data also suggest that brain and kidney cancer have patterns of transcriptomic dysregulation in the PI3K/AKT/MTOR axis that are similar to those found in ASD.ConclusionsComparisons of ASD and cancer differential gene expression meta-analysis results suggest that brain, kidney, thyroid, and pancreatic cancers are candidates for direct comorbid associations with ASD. On the other hand, lung and prostate cancers are candidates for inverse comorbid associations with ASD. Joint perturbations in a set of specific biological processes underlie these associations which include several pathways previously implicated in both cancer and ASD encompassing immune system alterations, impairments of energy metabolism, cell cycle, and signaling through PI3K and G protein-coupled receptors among others. These findings could help to explain epidemiological observations pointing towards direct and inverse comorbid associations between ASD and specific cancer types and depict a complex scenario regarding the molecular patterns of association between ASD and cancer.",Professor Rafael Tabarés-Seisdedos and Jaume Forés were supported in part by grant number PROMETEOII/2015/021 from Generalitat Valenciana and the national grant PI17/00719 from ISCIII-FEDER.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Autistic Disorder; Brain; Humans; Neoplasms; Signal Transduction; Transcriptome,08/04/2019,2019,08/04/2019,2019-12,10,1,17,All OA; Gold,Article,"Forés-Martos, Jaume; Catalá-López, Ferrán; Sánchez-Valle, Jon; Ibáñez, Kristina; Tejero, Héctor; Palma-Gudiel, Helena; Climent, Joan; Pancaldi, Vera; Fañanás, Lourdes; Arango, Celso; Parellada, Mara; Baudot, Anaïs; Vogt, Daniel; Rubenstein, John L.; Valencia, Alfonso; Tabarés-Seisdedos, Rafael","Forés-Martos, Jaume (Biomedical Research Networking Center of Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain); Catalá-López, Ferrán (Biomedical Research Networking Center of Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain; Teaching Unit of Psychiatry and Psychological Medicine, Department of Medicine, University of Valencia, Blasco-Ibañez 15, 46010, Valencia, Spain; INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain; Department of Health Planning and Economics, National School of Public Health/IMIENS, Institute of Health Carlos III, Madrid, Spain); Sánchez-Valle, Jon (Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Barcelona, Spain); Ibáñez, Kristina (Genomics England, London, UK); Tejero, Héctor (Structural Biology Program, Spanish National Cancer Research Program (CNIO), Madrid, Spain); Palma-Gudiel, Helena (Biomedical Research Networking Center of Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain; Anthropology Section, Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Biomedicine Institute (IBUB), University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Spain); Climent, Joan (INCLIVA Health Research Institute, Valencia, Spain; Departamento de Ciencias Biomédicas, Facultad de Ciencias de la Salud, Universidad Cardenal Herrera-CEU, CEU Universities, Calle Ramon y Cajal s/n 46115 Alfara del Patriarca, Valencia, Spain); Pancaldi, Vera (Barcelona Supercomputing Center (BSC), Barcelona, Spain); Fañanás, Lourdes (Biomedical Research Networking Center of Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain; Anthropology Section, Department of Evolutionary Biology, Ecology and Environmental Sciences, Biomedicine Institute (IBUB), University of Barcelona (UB), Barcelona, Spain); Arango, Celso (Biomedical Research Networking Center of Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, IiSGM, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain); Parellada, Mara (Biomedical Research Networking Center of Mental Health (CIBERSAM), Madrid, Spain; Department of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry, Hospital General Universitario Gregorio Marañón, IiSGM, School of Medicine, Universidad Complutense, Madrid, Spain); Baudot, Anaïs (Aix-Marseille Univ, Inserm, MMG, Marseille Medical Genetics, Marseille, France); Vogt, Daniel (Department of Pediatrics and Human Development, Michigan State University, 48824, East Lansing, MI, USA); Rubenstein, John L.

The task proceeds through a number of stages, and it is generally claimed that patterns of errors across stages can be used to discriminate between reduced attention switching and more general reductions in rates of learning. A number of papers have used the IEDS task to argue for specific attention shifting difficulties in Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) and Schizophrenia, however, it remains unclear how well the IEDS really differentiates between reduced attention shifting and other causes of impaired performance. To address this issue, we introduce a simple computational model of performance in the IEDS task, designed to separate the competing effects of attention shifting and general learning rate. We fit the model to data from ASD and comparison individuals matched on age and IQ, as well as to data from four previous studies which used the IEDS task. Model fits do not show consistent evidence for reductions in attention shifting rates in ASD and Schizophrenia. Instead, we find performance is better explained by differences in learning rate, particularly from punishment, which we show correlates with IQ. We, therefore, argue that the IEDS task is not a good measure of attention shifting in clinical groups. LAY SUMMARY: The Intra-Extra-Dimensional Set shift task (IEDS) is often given to autistic individuals, who tend to make more errors relative to comparison groups. This higher error rate is taken to mean that autistic individuals struggle with attention control. Our computational model of the IEDS shows that the performance of ASD and some other clinical groups can be explained instead by differences in learning rate, rather than differences in attention control.","Model fitting was performed on City, University of London&#x27;s Solon High Performance Computing Cluster.

Motor deficits are among the earliest and most prominent symptoms in individuals with ASC and precede core social and communicative symptoms.MethodsHere, we investigate whether motor circuit connectivity is (1) atypically lateralized in children with ASC and (2) whether this relates to core autistic symptoms and motor performance. Participants comprised 44 right-handed high-functioning children with autism (36 males, 8 females) and 80 typically developing control children (58 males, 22 females) matched on age, sex and performance IQ. We examined lateralization of functional motor circuit connectivity based on homotopic seeds derived from peak activations during a finger tapping paradigm. Motor performance was assessed using the Physical and Neurological Examination for Subtle Signs (PANESS).ResultsChildren with ASC showed rightward lateralization in mean motor circuit connectivity compared to typically developing children, and this was associated with poorer performance on all three PANESS measures.ConclusionsOur findings reveal that atypical lateralization in ASC is not restricted to language functions but is also present in circuits subserving motor functions and may underlie motor deficits in children with ASC. Future studies should investigate whether this is an age-invariant finding extending to adolescents and adults and whether these asymmetries relate to atypical lateralization in the language domain.","We would like to thank all the families who participated in the study.

Atypical processing and integration of sensory inputs are hypothesized to play a role in unusual sensory reactions and social-cognitive deficits in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Reports on the relationship between objective metrics of sensory processing and clinical symptoms, however, are surprisingly sparse. Here we examined the relationship between neurophysiological assays of sensory processing and (1) autism severity and (2) sensory sensitivities, in individuals with ASD aged 6–17. Multiple linear regression indicated significant associations between neural markers of auditory processing and multisensory integration, and autism severity. No such relationships were apparent for clinical measures of visual/auditory sensitivities. These data support that aberrant early sensory processing contributes to autism symptoms, and reveal the potential of electrophysiology to objectively subtype autism.","Primary funding for this work was provided through a grant from the U.S. National Institute of Mental Health (MH085322 to S.M. and J.J.F.).

Three intrinsic connectivity networks (ICNs) are especially important to cognitive processing in ASD: the default mode network (DMN), executive control network (ECN), and salience networks (SNs). The goal of this study was to compare resting-state functional connectivity between the cerebellum and the DMN, ECN, and SN in ASD and typically developing children (n = 74, ages 7–12 years). Children with ASD showed stronger connectivity between the ventral DMN and left cerebellar lobules I–IV.

Such impairment may underlie core deficits in cognition and social functioning. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) has been shown to enhance WM in both healthy adults and clinical populations, but its efficacy in ASD is unknown. We predicted that bifrontal tDCS would improve WM performances of adults with high-functioning autism during active stimulation compared to sham stimulation and that such enhancement would generalize to an untrained task.MethodsTwelve adults with high-functioning ASD engaged in a battery of WM tasks that included backward spatial span, backward digit span, spatial n-back and letter n-back. While engaged, 40 min of 1.5 mA bifrontal stimulation was applied over the left and the right dorsolateral prefrontal cortices (DLPFC). Using a single-blind crossover design, each participant received left anodal/right cathodal stimulation, right anodal/left cathodal stimulation, or sham stimulation, in randomized counterbalanced order on three separate days. Following tDCS, participants again engaged in letter and spatial n-back tasks before taking the Brief Test of Attention (BTA). We used repeated-measures ANOVA to compare overall performance on the WM battery as measured by a composite of z-scores for all five measures. Post hoc ANOVAs, t tests, Friedman’s tests, and Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to measure the online and offline effects of tDCS and to assess performances on individual measures.ResultsCompared to sham stimulation, both left DLPFC anodal stimulation (t11 = 5.4, p = 0.0002) and right DLPFC anodal stimulation (t11 = 3.57, p = 0.004) improved overall WM performance. Left anodal stimulation (t11 = 3.9, p = 0.003) and right anodal stimulation (t11 = 2.7, p = 0.019) enhanced performances during stimulation. Enhancement transferred to an untrained task 50 min after right anodal stimulation (z11 = 2.263, p = 0.024). The tasks that showed the largest effects of active stimulation were spatial span backward (z11 = 2.39, p = 0.017) and BTA (z11 = 2.263, p = 0.024).ConclusionsIn adults with high-functioning ASD, active bifrontal tDCS given during WM tasks appears to improve performance. TDCS benefits also transferred to an untrained task completed shortly after stimulation. These results suggest that tDCS can improve WM task performance and could reduce some core deficits of autism.Trial registrationNCT01602263",We thank Patrick Chambers and Jessica O’Grady for help recruiting and testing study participants and Nancy Grund for editorial assistance.

However, surprisingly little research has gone toward this core symptom, and some studies suggest the preference for predictability in ASD might be less general than commonly assumed. Here, we investigated this important symptom of ASD using three different paradigms, which allowed us to measure preference for predictability under well-controlled experimental conditions. Specifically, we used a dimensional approach by investigating correlations between autistic traits (as measured with the Autism-Spectrum Quotient and Social Responsiveness Scale in a neurotypical population) and the scores on three different tasks. The ""music preference"" task assessed preferences for tone sequences that varied in predictability. The ""perceptual fluency"" task required participants to evaluate stimuli that were preceded by a similar versus dissimilar subliminally presented prime. The ""gambling"" task presented four decks of cards that had equal outcome probabilities but varied in predictability. We observed positive correlations between autistic traits and a preference for predictability in both the music preference and perceptual fluency task. We did not find our hypothesized correlation with gambling behavior but did observe a post hoc correlation showing that participants with more autistic traits were faster to choose the predictable deck. Together, these findings show that a relation between autistic traits and preference for predictability can be observed in a standardized lab environment, and should be considered an important first step toward a better, more mechanistic understanding of insistence on sameness in ASD.

LAY SUMMARY: A core symptom of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a strong preference for predictability, but little research has gone toward it. We show that neurotypical adults with more autistic traits have stronger preferences for predictable tunes, evaluate images that can be predicted as more beautiful, and are faster in choosing a gambling option resulting in predictable reward. These results offer the first important evidence that insistence on sameness in ASD can be studied in controlled lab settings.",J.G. was supported by a PhD fellowship by the FWO— Research Foundation Flanders.

We measured recognition of 6 basic facial expressions at 8 intensity levels in young people (6–16 years) with ASD (N = 63) and controls (N = 64) via an Internet platform. Participants with ASD were less accurate than controls at labelling expressions across intensity levels, although differences at very low levels were not detected due to floor effects. Recognition accuracy did not correlate with parent-reported social functioning in either group. These findings provide further evidence for an impairment in recognition of basic emotion in ASD and do not support the idea that this impairment is limited solely to low intensity expressions.",We would like to thank all of the children and families who took part in this study.

The ‘Interactional Heterogeneity Hypothesis’ of ASD proposes that the degree to which individuals share a common ground substantially influences their ability to achieve smooth social interactions.MethodsTo test this hypothesis, we filmed 29 autistic and 29 matched typically developed adults engaged in several conversational tasks. Windowed cross-lagged correlations were computed using the time series of motion energy of both individuals in a dyad. These coefficients were then compared across the three dyad types that were homo- or heterogenous with respect to diagnosis: pairs of two autistic individuals, two typically developed individuals or pairs of one autistic and one typically developed person.ResultsWe found that all dyad types achieved above-chance interpersonal synchrony, but that synchrony was more expressed in typical dyads compared to both autistic and mixed dyads.LimitationsThe method presented here provides only one, albeit objective and robust, approach to explore synchrony. The methodological choices as well as the lack of consideration for other communication modalities may limit our interpretation of the findings. Moreover, the sample size is small with respect to exploring associations between synchrony and various outcome and social skill measures.ConclusionsThe present results do not provide support for the Interactional Heterogeneity Hypothesis given that autistic individuals do not coordinate better when interacting with another autistic individual, compared to when interacting with a typical individual.","We would like to thank the participants for volunteering their time.

Here, we give an overview on what is already known about autism diagnosis in adulthood and find areas that need more research. We divided results from the studies we found into six topics of (1) rates of autism in different groups; (2) the process of getting an autism diagnosis in adulthood; (3) gender; (4) personality traits, abilities and behaviours of diagnosed adults; (5) mental and physical health conditions that occur together with autism; and (6) how adults think and feel about being assessed and diagnosed. We found that adults often have strong emotions after being diagnosed, the process of getting a diagnosis can be unclear and different for everyone, and not many support services are available for adults. More research on diagnosing adults with intellectual disability, differences between early and late-diagnosed adults, and support after diagnosis would be useful.",,Autism,,"1362-3613, 1461-7005",Adult; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Humans; Intellectual Disability,28/02/2020,2020,28/02/2020,2020-08,24,6,1311-1327,Closed,Article,"Huang, Yunhe; Arnold, Samuel RC; Foley, Kitty-Rose; Trollor, Julian N","Huang, Yunhe (University of New South Wales, Australia; The Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), Australia); Arnold, Samuel RC (University of New South Wales, Australia; The Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), Australia); Foley, Kitty-Rose (University of New South Wales, Australia; Southern Cross University, Australia); Trollor, Julian N (University of New South Wales, Australia; The Cooperative Research Centre for Living with Autism (Autism CRC), Australia)","Arnold, Samuel RC (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC)","Huang, Yunhe (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC); Arnold, Samuel RC (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC); Foley, Kitty-Rose (UNSW Sydney; Southern Cross University); Trollor, Julian N (UNSW Sydney; Autism CRC)",Southern Cross University; Autism CRC; UNSW Sydney,grid.1031.3; grid.478764.e; grid.1005.4,Australia; Australia; Australia,,51,50,6.41,26.38,49,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1125174786,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,Yes,DOI 10.17605/OSF.IO/DB78Q.,Systematic Review,Cannot find

Reductions in GABA are proposed to result in an overly excitatory cortex that may cause, or contribute to, symptoms of autism spectrum disorder (ASD). This study employed a cross-sectional design to explore GABA+ differences in ASD and the impact of age, comparing 4-12 year olds with ASD (N = 24) to typically developing children (N = 35). GABA+ concentration was measured using edited magnetic resonance spectroscopy in the left parietal lobe. This study used a mixed model to investigate group differences between children with ASD and typically developing children. There was a significant difference in GABA+ levels between the groups, a significant effect of age and interaction between age and diagnostic group. The ASD group showed an association between GABA+ and age, with GABA+ levels gradually increasing with age (r = 0.59, p = 0.003). Typically developing children did not show age-related change in GABA+ concentration (r = 0.09, p = 0.60). By the age of 9, children with ASD showed GABA+ levels that were comparable to their typically developing peers. This study suggests that children with ASD have initially lower levels of GABA+ in the left parietal lobe compared to typically developing children, and that these initially lower levels of GABA+ increase with age in ASD within this region. It is suggested that this developmental shift of GABA+ levels within the left parietal lobe provides a possible explanation for the previously found reductions in childhood that does not persist in adults. LAY SUMMARY: This study measured levels of GABA in the left parietal lobe using magnetic resonance spectroscopy in children with ASD and typically developing children. GABA levels were initially lower in the ASD group, and increased with age, while GABA did not change with age in the typically developing group. This suggests that alterations in GABA signaling may be associated with ASD in childhood.

Historical and recent theory, evidence and personal accounts within the autism community present a mixed picture regarding Autistic children’s prosocial engagement. This systematic review consolidates, for the first time, how empirical studies have been measuring Autistic children’s prosocial behaviour to date (objective one). This review clarifies what knowledge the evidence provides, specifically how the type (e.g., comforting, helping, sharing), target (e.g., parent, experimenter, Autistic or neurotypical peer) and timing (e.g., young, middle, and late childhood) affect Autistic children’s prosocial behaviour (objective two). Methods Relevant published records were identified through systematic searches of three electronic databases: PsychINFO, PubMED and Embase. Thirty studies presented in 29 articles met eligibility criteria and were included for data-extraction, quality assessment and narrative synthesis. Results The most common methodologies used were found to be: in-person paradigms, games, informant reports, and self-reports. Reliability and validity efforts were inconsistent. It is hoped these findings will act as a benchmark for development of future research in the area. Outcomes were found to be much more positive about Autistic children’s engagement in prosocial behaviour than diagnostic criteria and historical theory suggests, with Autistic children often engaging in prosocial behaviour to the same frequency as comparison groups despite unfamiliar and neurotypical targets. Narrative synthesis revealed moderating variables and differing patterns and styles of Autistic children’s prosocial behaviour. Conclusions Findings encourage Autistic strengths-based approaches and caution is expressed regarding findings possibly linked to Autistic masking.","The authors would like to thank research assistants Alexandria O Reilly Mescall, UCD, for assisting data extraction and quality assessment process, and Maurice O&#x27;Doherty, for error checking extracted data.

The trial encountered problems in recruitment, enrollment and retention which are described here. Methods : Of 169 eligible participants, only 22 consented and were randomly assigned to Smiling Mind (n = 12) or an attention control condition (n = 10). A further six participants withdrew during the study. Barriers to trial participation were subsequently explored through semi-structured interviews, to form case studies, and a follow-up survey. Results Interview and survey data highlighted parents’ competing time commitments as a key barrier to participation. For children and adults with ASD, distraction and boredom were major challenges to engagement. Conclusions A number of modifiable variables in our recruitment procedures and intervention design ultimately resulted in a sample size that was too small to draw any firm conclusions from. Future ASD research can maximize sampling by broadening recruitment strategies and partnering with community services and schools.

                                    of children with distinct psychological characteristics as
                                    ‘autistic psychopaths’ in 1938, several years before Leo
                                    Kanner’s famous 1943 paper on autism. In 1944, Asperger
                                    published a comprehensive study on the topic (submitted to
                                    Vienna University in 1942 as his postdoctoral thesis), which
                                    would only find international acknowledgement in the 1980s. From
                                    then on, the eponym ‘Asperger’s syndrome’ increasingly gained
                                    currency in recognition of his outstanding contribution to the
                                    conceptualization of the condition. At the time, the fact that
                                    Asperger had spent pivotal years of his career in Nazi Vienna
                                    caused some controversy regarding his potential ties to National
                                    Socialism and its race hygiene policies. Documentary evidence
                                    was scarce, however, and over time a narrative of Asperger as an
                                    active opponent of National Socialism took hold. The main goal
                                    of this paper is to re-evaluate this narrative, which is based
                                    to a large extent on statements made by Asperger himself and on
                                    a small segment of his published work.MethodsDrawing on a vast array of contemporary
                                    publications and previously unexplored archival documents
                                    (including Asperger’s personnel files and the clinical
                                    assessments he wrote on his patients), this paper offers a
                                    critical examination of Asperger’s life, politics, and career
                                    before and during the Nazi period in Austria.ResultsAsperger managed to accommodate himself to the
                                    Nazi regime and was rewarded for his affirmations of loyalty
                                    with career opportunities. He joined several organizations
                                    affiliated with the NSDAP (although not the Nazi party itself),
                                    publicly legitimized race hygiene policies including forced

This study investigated perceived needs of grandparents of preschool-aged children diagnosed with ASD in the cultural context of Sweden. Participants were 120 grandparents of children enrolled into autism intervention programs provided by the public disability services in Stockholm. The Grandparents’ Needs Survey and the SDQ Impact supplement were used to collect data. Grandparents expressed most needs in topic areas of information and childcare. No significant relations were found between grandparents’ demographics and perceptions of needs; grandparents’ needs were predicted by their perceived burden. The findings provide insight into understanding of grandparents’ needs essential for planning and provision of quality family-centered early intervention services.,"This study was funded by a PhD student scholarship awarded to the first author by the Department of Special Education, Stockholm University.

The aim of this review is to briefly introduce diffusion tensor imaging methods that examine white matter tracts and then to give an overview of the studies that have investigated white matter integrity in the brains of individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). From the 48 studies we reviewed, persons with ASD tended to have decreased fractional anisotropy and increased mean diffusivity in white matter tracts spanning many regions of the brain but most consistently in regions such as the corpus callosum, cingulum, and aspects of the temporal lobe. This decrease in fractional anisotropy was often accompanied by increased radial diffusivity. Additionally, the review suggests possible atypical lateralization in some white matter tracts of the brain and a possible atypical developmental trajectory of white matter microstructure in persons with ASD. Clinical implications and future research directions are discussed.","This work was supported by National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (NICHD) T32 HD07489 Postdoctoral Training Award (BGT); NICHD P30 HD003352 (ALA); National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) P50 MH84051 (ALA), NIMH RO1 MH080826 (JEL, ALA, EDB, NL), the Morgridge Institutes for Research (MIR‐University of Wisconsin; NA).

626,604,pub.1134186702,10.1002/aur.2461,33377301,,,A Systematic Literature Review of Autism Research on Caregiver Talk,"Describing how caregivers' talk to their autistic children, and how their talk may influence social and language outcomes, has important implications for developmental theory and intervention research. In this systematic literature review, we examine 294 caregiver talk variables extracted from 65 studies, provide a narrative overview of research findings, and link measurement approaches to various theories of language development. The majority of variables included only talk directed to children (90%), and specified the speech act being performed (57%). More than one-third of variables measured talk that was responsive to children's attention, activities, or communication (38%), and slightly less than a third measured variables that elicited children's communication or engagement. Semantic aspects of talk were specified in 41% of variables, structural features were measured in 20% of variables, and suprasegmental features were measured in only 1% of variables. Talk quantity (without reference to other aspects of talk) was measured in 8% of variables. We found strong support that talk related to children's attention is implicated in autistic children's language development, but this construct has been measured inconsistently in terms of semantic, structural, and functional features. There is also evidence for bi-directional relationships between caregiver's talk and autistic children's development on a variety of semantic and structural variables. LAY SUMMARY: In our review, we found many differences in how researchers measured caregiver's talk, but also some promising leads. Researchers should continue examining caregiver talk related to children's focus of attention to clarify how this type of language contributes to autistic children's development. We also found interesting research on how children influence caregiver's talk, and encourage researchers to continue to study how this occurs.",,Autism Research,,"1939-3792, 1939-3806",Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Caregivers; Child; Communication; Humans; Language Development,29/12/2020,2020,29/12/2020,2021-03,14,3,432-449,Closed,Article,"Bottema‐Beutel, Kristen; Kim, So Yoon","Bottema‐Beutel, Kristen (Lynch School of Education and Human Development, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, USA); Kim, So Yoon (Lynch School of Education and Human Development, Boston College, Chestnut Hill, Massachusetts, USA)","Bottema‐Beutel, Kristen (Boston College)","Bottema‐Beutel, Kristen (Boston College); Kim, So Yoon (Boston College)",Boston College,grid.208226.c,United States,,16,16,6.42,8.28,23,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1134186702,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,Locked Open Data

Higher autistic traits are also related to poorer QOL. However, the role of alexithymia in this relationship has not been explored.
METHOD: A total of 163 participants (N = 53 autistic and N = 111 comparison) consented to take part; however, 30 participants were excluded due to missing data (who did not differ from those who were retained on age, gender, education, employment, or living status), leaving a final sample of 133 (N = 42 Autistic and 91 Comparison participants). Demographic information (including age, gender) was collected, alongside self-report measures of autistic traits, mental health, alexithymia, and QOL. We estimated regression models based on pre-registered analysis, and we conducted exploratory network analyses.
RESULTS: Alexithymic traits did not predict QOL when controlling for covariates. Depression significantly predicted Physical, Psychological, and Social QOL. When examining the impact of just alexithymic traits and autistic traits, both were significantly associated with Physical and Psychological QOL. For participants with a low depression score, the correlation between alexithymia and QOL was strong; suggesting that depression occludes the association between alexithymia and QOL. Network analyses suggested that depression and anxiety exert direct effects on Physical and Psychological QOL, whereas alexithymia scores may influence Physical QOL via autistic traits.
CONCLUSION: In sum, depression is a pervasive negative predictor of multiple QOL domains. The role of alexithymia in predicting QOL dimensionally and categorically was not ruled out, given our exploratory analyses, we suggest that interventions which target alexithymia may positively impact QOL for those who score low on depressive symptoms.","We would like to thank the participants who gave their time and completed the questionnaires.

A systematic review,"Background Circumscribed interests (CI) are a subcategory of restricted and repetitive behaviors that occur commonly in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). CI are characterized by an intense and focused interest in a narrow range of subjects. The purpose of this systematic review is to determine how interests are incorporated within interventions for individuals with ASD across the lifespan; what symptoms, domains and outcomes these interventions target; and the effectiveness of such interventions. Method The methods used within this review were consistent with those recommended by the Cochrane and Campbell Collaborations. Inclusion criteria were based on three predetermined categories: (1) Study Population; (2) Intervention Design; and (3) Outcome Variables. Data were extracted and coded based on these three predetermined categories. Results 246 full-text articles were assessed for eligibility, of which 31 studies were eligible for data extraction. The majority of studies were single subject designs (k = 28) and focused on toddlers/preschool (k = 13) or school-aged children (k = 17). Common interests utilized were TV shows or movies (N = 21), popular characters (N = 18), computers/video games (N = 12) and transportation (N = 11). Conclusions Results suggest that the inclusion of CI within interventions can lead to positive effects across a number of domains. More research is required to examine the effects of individualized interests within group design studies.

Several neural systems support this ability, including the theory of mind (ToM) network and the somatosensory system linked to embodied resonance, but it is unclear how these systems are affected in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). Individuals with ASD exhibit impairments in the use of nonverbal communication such as social and reciprocal touch. Despite the importance of touch in social communication and the reported touch aversion in ASD, surprisingly little is known about the neural systems underlying impairments in touch communication in ASD.MethodsThe present study applies a dynamic and socially meaningful stimulus set combined with functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) to pinpoint atypicalities in the neural circuitry underlying socio-affective touch observation in adults with ASD. Twenty-one adults with ASD and 21 matched neurotypical adults evaluated the valence and arousal of 75 video fragments displaying touch interactions. Subsequently, they underwent fMRI while watching the same videos. Using multi-voxel pattern analysis (MVPA) and multiple regression analysis, we examined which brain regions represent the socio-affective meaning of observed touch. To further understand the brain-behavior relationship, we correlated the strength of affective representations in the somatosensory cortex with individuals’ attitude towards social touch in general and with a quantitative index of autism traits as measured by the Social Responsiveness Scale.ResultsResults revealed that the affective meaning of touch was well represented in the temporoparietal junction, a core mentalizing area, in both groups. Conversely, only the neurotypical group represented affective touch in the somatosensory cortex, a region involved in self-experienced touch. Lastly, irrespective of the group, individuals with a more positive attitude towards receiving, witnessing, and providing social touch and with a higher score on social responsivity showed more differentiated representations of the affective meaning of touch in these somatosensory areas.ConclusionsTogether, our findings imply that male adults with ASD show intact cognitive understanding (i.e., “knowing”) of observed socio-affective touch interactions, but lack of spontaneous embodied resonance (i.e., “feeling”).","The authors thank all the participants who take part in this study.

Behavioural and neurocognitive heterogeneity in ASD and ADHD has hampered attempts to map the underlying genetics and neurobiology, predict intervention response, and improve diagnostic accuracy. Moving away from categorical conceptualisations of psychopathology to a dimensional approach is anticipated to facilitate discovery of data-driven clusters and enhance our understanding of the neurobiological and genetic aetiology of these conditions. The Monash Autism-ADHD genetics and neurodevelopment (MAGNET) project is one of the first large-scale, family-based studies to take a truly transdiagnostic approach to ASD and ADHD. Using a comprehensive phenotyping protocol capturing dimensional traits central to ASD and ADHD, the MAGNET project aims to identify data-driven clusters across ADHD-ASD spectra using deep phenotyping of symptoms and behaviours; investigate the degree of familiality for different dimensional ASD-ADHD phenotypes and clusters; and map the neurocognitive, brain imaging, and genetic correlates of these data-driven symptom-based clusters.MethodsThe MAGNET project will recruit 1,200 families with children who are either typically developing, or who display elevated ASD, ADHD, or ASD-ADHD traits, in addition to affected and unaffected biological siblings of probands, and parents. All children will be comprehensively phenotyped for behavioural symptoms, comorbidities, neurocognitive and neuroimaging traits and genetics.ConclusionThe MAGNET project will be the first large-scale family study to take a transdiagnostic approach to ASD-ADHD, utilising deep phenotyping across behavioural, neurocognitive, brain imaging and genetic measures.",A huge thank you to all the families who have participated so far.,Molecular Autism,,2040-2392,Attention Deficit Disorder with Hyperactivity; Autism Spectrum Disorder; Autistic Disorder; Humans; Magnets; Neurobiology,05/08/2021,2021,05/08/2021,2021-12,12,1,55,All OA; Gold,Article,"Knott, Rachael; Johnson, Beth P.; Tiego, Jeggan; Mellahn, Olivia; Finlay, Amy; Kallady, Kathryn; Kouspos, Maria; Mohanakumar Sindhu, Vishnu Priya; Hawi, Ziarih; Arnatkeviciute, Aurina; Chau, Tracey; Maron, Dalia; Mercieca, Emily-Clare; Furley, Kirsten; Harris, Katrina; Williams, Katrina; Ure, Alexandra; Fornito, Alex; Gray, Kylie; Coghill, David; Nicholson, Ann; Phung, Dinh; Loth, Eva; Mason, Luke; Murphy, Declan; Buitelaar, Jan; Bellgrove, Mark A.","Knott, Rachael (Turner Institute for Brain and Mental Health, School of Psychological Sciences, Monash University, 18 Innovation Walk, 3800, Melbourne, VIC, Australia); Johnson, Beth P.

Social cognition training (SCT) is commonly used for improving social functioning, but lacks ecological validity and the ability to effectively mimic social situations. Development of virtual reality (VR) interventions, focusing on enhancing social cognition, could add to the effectiveness of SCT within ASD care, by offering a safe, interactive and practical training setting, where generalization of knowledge and skills to the real-world are promoted. In this paper, our primary aim is to evaluate the feasibility and acceptance by participants and therapists of the Dynamic Interactive Social Cognition Method Training in Virtual Reality (DiSCoVR) protocol as developed for adults with schizophrenic spectrum disorder (SSD), adapted for ASD (DiSCoVR-A). 26 participants, aged 18–63, took part in a pilot study. 22 participants completed baseline and post-assessment, including primary outcome evaluation assessment through a semi-structured interview. Secondary measures focused on social cognition, emotion recognition, mental flexibility, social anxiety, empathy and social responsiveness and were assessed at baseline (T0), post-treatment (T1), and at follow-up (T2) sixteen weeks after completion of the intervention. Results Our results show that the majority of participant and therapists found the VR intervention acceptable and feasible, as reported in evaluation questionnaires and interviews. Conclusion These preliminary findings are promising; however, controlled research is needed to further investigate the effectiveness of VR within social cognition training for adults with ASD.","We would like to thank all our participants and therapists who participated in the study.

The aim of the present study is to conduct a systematic review on the prevalence of psychiatric disorders in adults with ASD (PROSPERO’s reference number CRD42016041948). Four databases (PubMed, PsycINFO, Web of Science and CINAHL) were used for the electronic search, and six editorials (Science Direct, Wiley, Springer, Taylor & Francis, SAGE Publishing and BioMed Central) were manually searched for studies not previously identified. Study eligibility criteria were observational studies on psychiatric comorbidity in adults (18 years or older) with ASD, based on standard diagnostic classifications (DSM/ICD), reported in English peer-reviewed journals. A total of 1288 and 24 references were identified by electronic and manual searches, respectively. Results showed that attention deficit and hyperactivity disorder is the most prevalent psychiatric disorder in adults with ASD. Mood and anxiety disorders are also very frequent among this population. The lowest comorbidity prevalence rates of all diagnostic categories are the ones related to substance use and eating disorders. These results show a need for a greater production of studies in this field, especially follow-up studies that focus on risk and protective factors for the emergence of psychiatric problems in adults with ASD. For this reason, it is imperative to create specific diagnostic tools that allow the assessment of mental pathology, attending to the particularities of its manifestation in people with ASD.","This research was conducted as a part of first author’s PhD project.

In the last 10 years, there have been significant advances in understanding the genetic basis for ASD, critically supported through the establishment of ASD bio-collections and application in research. Here, we summarise a selection of major ASD bio-collections and their associated findings. Collectively, these include mapping ASD candidate genes, assessing the nature and frequency of gene mutations and their association with ASD clinical subgroups, insights into related molecular pathways such as the synapses, chromatin remodelling, transcription and ASD-related brain regions. We also briefly review emerging studies on the use of induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) to potentially model ASD in culture. These provide deeper insight into ASD progression during development and could generate human cell models for drug screening.

MANOVA indicated that mothers rated their sons’ SF significantly less severely than the boys did themselves and that younger boys received more severe ratings from their mothers than older boys did. There was a significant interaction between source of assessment and age of the boys, due to the mothers assessing their older sons’ SF less severely than their younger sons but the sons showing the opposite trend in self-ratings. These findings challenge the validity of clinical assessments of SF that are based solely upon parents’ ratings and argue for a more comprehensive approach to diagnosing the presence and severity of SF in boys with an ASD.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2016-02,2016,,2016-02,22,,Oct-19,Closed,Article,"Bitsika, Vicki; Sharpley, Christopher F.; Mills, Richard","Bitsika, Vicki (Bond University, University Drive, Robina, Queensland 4229, Australia); Sharpley, Christopher F.

In contrast clinician led parent targeted interventions focusing on positive parental outcomes such as mental health and psychological well-being are often over-looked. This review systematically considered outcomes in relation to parent-targeted clinician led interventions to support parents’ mental health and well-being. The Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses guidelines were followed. Selected articles focused on parent-targeted interventions with a therapeutic and psychoeducational approach delivered directly to one or both parent carers of a child with ASD. Of the 1756 articles screened eight studies were included with 307 participants. Parent focused interventions based on Mindfulness, Cognitive Behaviour Therapy, Acceptance and Commitment Therapy, and Non-Directive Counselling approaches were identified. Participating in clinician-led group interventions introducing stress management strategies, biofeedback, mindfulness, acceptance, and problem-solving skills had a positive effect on parents’ mental health and well-being. Participating in groups with a parent focused therapy and psychoeducation component improves parents’ well-being and quality of life and suggests a fruitful avenue for future clinical practice and research that may ultimately broadly benefit all family members.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2020-08,2020,,2020-08,76,,101584,Closed,Article,"Merriman, Kieron; Burke, Tom; O’Reilly, Gary","Merriman, Kieron (Health Service Executive, Ireland and University College Dublin, Ireland); Burke, Tom (Health Service Executive, Ireland and University College Dublin, Ireland); O’Reilly, Gary (University College Dublin, Ireland)","O’Reilly, Gary (University College Dublin)","Merriman, Kieron (Health Service Executive; University College Dublin); Burke, Tom (Health Service Executive; University College Dublin); O’Reilly, Gary (University College Dublin)",University College Dublin; Health Service Executive,grid.7886.1; grid.424617.2,Ireland; Ireland,,1,1,,0.49,20,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1127766557,52 Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,3 Good Health and Well Being,Yes,,Systematic Review,Cant't find - ID in paper and title didn't work

Despite extensive investigation into the correlates of social functioning in ASD, only recently has there been focus on the role of low-level sensory input, particularly visual processing. Extensive gaze deficits have been described in ASD, from basic saccadic function through to social attention and the processing of complex biological motion. Given that social functioning often relies on accurately processing visual information, inefficient visual processing may contribute to the emergence and sustainment of social functioning difficulties in ASD. To explore the association between measures of gaze and social functioning in ASD, a systematic review and meta-analysis was conducted. A total of 95 studies were identified from a search of CINAHL Plus, Embase, OVID Medline, and psycINFO databases in July 2021. Findings support associations between increased gaze to the face/head and eye regions with improved social functioning and reduced autism symptom severity. However, gaze allocation to the mouth appears dependent on social and emotional content of scenes and the cognitive profile of participants. This review supports the investigation of gaze variables as potential biomarkers of ASD, although future longitudinal studies are required to investigate the developmental progression of this relationship and to explore the influence of heterogeneity in ASD clinical characteristics. LAY SUMMARY: This review explored how eye gaze (e.g., where a person looks when watching a movie) is associated with social functioning in autism spectrum disorder (ASD). We found evidence that better social functioning in ASD was associated with increased eye gaze toward faces/head and eye regions. Individual characteristics (e.g., intelligence) and the complexity of the social scene also influenced eye gaze. Future research including large longitudinal studies and studies investigating the influence of differing presentations of ASD are recommended.","Peter Enticott is supported by a Future Fellowship from the Australian Research Council (FT160100077).

Methods Of the 126 children included in the present study HC was possible to measure in 114 individuals. However, two of these children were not diagnosed since they did not conclude the study, leaving 112 children for further assessment. In addition, birth data was recovered either from the digital birth sheet used in Sweden for the registration of birth data, or in a few cases from the Child Care Centers or medical journals if the child had been admitted to hospital care after birth. Results Of the 112 individuals, only one individual, a boy, diagnosed with ICD-10 Autism, had a HC above the 97.5th percentile at birth. At the physical assessment included in the study one individual, a boy (not the same boy as mentioned above) was found to have a HC above the 97.5th percentile. Hence, 1.2 % of the boys in this study with an ICD-10 ASD diagnosis were macrocephalic. In contrast, 6.7 % of the boys, and 8% of the girls, who received an ICD-10 ASD diagnosis had a HC below the 2.5th percentile and were considered microcephalic at the assessment. Conclusions The results from this study could not confirm previous research arguing macrocephaly to be considerably more common in ASD than in the general population. However, in contrast, the results from this study indicated that microcephaly could be more common in children with ICD-10 ASD, for both sexes, than in the general population. Since none of the children had been microcephalic at birth the results indicate a relative decrease in HC over time in these individuals.","The author wishes to thank all the children and their parent(s)/caregiver(s) for their participation in the study.

Here we aimed at assessing brain volume early in development to further elucidate previous findings in autism and determine whether this pattern is restricted to idiopathic autism or shared within the autistic phenotype (fragile X syndrome [FXS]). We investigated brain volume in 37 participants, using the fully automated Civet pipeline anatomical magnetic resonance imaging. 3 groups with intellectual deficiency: autism (AUT); its most associated FXS; and its most opposite Williams syndrome (WS) were compared with each other and with normal controls (NC). We report increased total and regional gray and white matter brain volume in AUT and FXS relative to WS and NC. These findings are discussed in light of the possibilities leading for the enlarged brain volume in children with the AUT phenotype. We speculate that this excess suggests reduced regression of neuronal processes “pruning” in cortical and subcortical regions in AUT/FXS, which may be due to a mutation in specific genes involved in pruning and/or a lack of socio-emotional environmental experience during a critical developmental period.","We express our deep appreciation to the individuals and families who gave generously of their time and courage to participate in these imaging studies.

Method This retrospective cohort study linked hospital discharge records for 8,951,763 California singleton births occurring 1/1/91-12/31/08 from the Office of Statewide Health Planning and Development with diagnostic and service records from the Department of Developmental Services. Medical records documenting maternal mood and anxiety disorders and schizophrenia ICD-9-CM codes were identified, and 42,423 children were categorized with a DSM-IV diagnosis of ‘autistic disorder’. Log-linear Poisson models explored the relationships between maternal psychiatric disorders and autism, adjusting for maternal education, race, country of birth, and parental age. Results Rates of maternal psychiatric diagnoses were lower than expected for the population, reflecting under-recognition and under-reporting by inpatient clinicians. In adjusted analyses, mothers diagnosed with one individual psychiatric condition were 1.2–2.8 times more likely to have a child who developed autism. Mothers diagnosed with any one or more psychiatric condition were twice as likely to have a child with autism compared with unaffected or unreported women (RR=1.97; 95% CI 1.83–2.12). Conclusions Women with a documented inpatient medical record history of psychiatric diagnosis were nearly twice as likely as women without such diagnoses to have a child later diagnosed with autism. These findings highlight the need for routine prenatal screening for psychiatric conditions, as well as enhanced neurobehavioral assessment of children born to these mothers to detect early autism signs and optimize intervention timeliness.","This work was supported by the National Institutes of Health, Eunice Kennedy Shriver National Institute of Child Health and Human Development (1R03HD074911-01).

Autism spectrum disorder relates to lower recognition of other-oriented lies through a decrease in perceived intentionality of the liar,"Background There is mixed evidence regarding how persons with ASD deal with deception. Some studies show that autism is related to difficulties in lying, others show no differences between individuals with ASD and typically developing persons in use of deception. It may be that individuals with ASD have difficulties in understanding what lying is. Method In Study 1 (N = 66) we matched a sample of individuals clinically diagnosed with autism spectrum disorder with typically developing individuals. Study 2 (N = 256) was conducted with participants from the general population. We asked participants to evaluate deceitfulness of protagonists’ behavior in stories presenting other-oriented and self-oriented lying. Results The results suggest that the higher the autistic traits, the less individuals perceive the liar as behaving intentionally. In the case of more complex, other-oriented lies, autistic traits indirectly relate to recognition of lies through attribution of intentionality.

However, differences between the narratives of children with and without ASD may be attenuated when cognitive and linguistic demands are reduced. Therefore, the present study examined whether incorporating a script-framework, that structures the story around common events, reduced children's difficulties with narratives.MethodThis study compared the narrative abilities of children with ASD (N=19) and neurotypical (NT; N=26) children on a script-based and a non-script based retelling task. Narratives were coded for microstructure, macrostructure, and type of script-based story events (script, non-script). The relation between narrative and theory of mind (ToM) was also assessed.ResultsIn comparison to their NT peers, children with ASD exhibited lower narrative production in terms of microstructure and macrostructure on both script and non-script based stories. In general, the narratives by children with ASD were less cohesive and coherent than the NT group. ToM ability and FSIQ predicted narrative coherence and cohesion in children with ASD. Moreover, examination of the script-based story revealed that children with ASD included the same number of script details as the NT children, but were less likely to include non-script details.ConclusionsThese findings provide evidence that narrative impairments may be present across narrative type, and that ToM ability in particular, predicts these difficulties in children with ASD. These findings have implications for common event understanding and highlight the need for early narrative intervention for children with ASD.","We would like to thank the children, parents, and staff who participated in this project.

There has been no research on the prevalence of ASD in Colombia, and few data from other Latin American nations have been published (Elsabbagh, et al., 2012; Zeidan, et al., 2022). Thus, the purpose of this study is to estimate the prevalence of ASD in Colombia in 2019 and to analyze the number of persons served between 2009 and 2019. This descriptive epidemiological study uses information from the Colombian Health Department system (SISPRO) to obtain reliable data to estimate the prevalence. The International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems was used to find information about healthcare services provided to autistic children in the country. In Colombia, 18,695 autistic children aged 0–14 received health services in 2019, for an estimated prevalence of 18.7/10,000 children. The statistics revealed an increasing trend in the number of persons with ASD served between 2009 and 2019. In terms of prevalence distribution by region, the prevalence ranged from 0.23 per 10,000 children (Guainía) to 17.29 per 10,000 children under 14 years old (Atlántico).

In spite of the large resemblances between the decision behaviour that is characteristic for maximizers and the decision behaviour displayed by individuals with autism, and the considerable overlap in the list of decision problems and decision experiences commonly reported by maximizers and individuals with autism, the question whether individuals with autism are more maximizing in decision-making as compared to neurotypical controls, has remained unexamined in the literature. The paper measures and compares the tendency to maximize, satisfice, and minimize in choice- and decision-making among autistic individuals and age, gender- and education degree-matched neurotypical individuals. Method The Decision Making Tendency Inventory measurement scale (Misuraca et al., 2015) is used to measure six types of decision-making tendency: fearful maximizing, resolute maximizing, more ambitious satisficing, less ambitious satisficing, parsimonious minimizing, and indolent minimizing. A multi-group confirmatory factor analysis and comparison of the differences in latent means is performed. Results The results demonstrate that autistic individuals are similar to neurotypical individuals when it comes to having a tendency to satisfice or minimize in decision-making, however, autistic individuals do score higher in terms of adopting a fearful and resolute maximizing tendency than neurotypical individuals. Conclusions Results suggest that higher maximizing tendency may explain for some of the difficulties experienced by autistic individuals in decision-making","I am grateful to Het Raster, Vlaamse Vereniging Autisme and PASS for participating in this research project and helping in the distribution of the survey, and members from the ECON-CEDON research group and Leuven Autism Research (LAuRes) at KU Leuven for comments and feedback.

A better understanding of positive contributions among this population can inform clinicians and policymakers and lead to improved outcomes for families. This review aimed to systematically examine studies measuring positive contributions among parents of children with ASD (<18 years) and to subsequently summarise the conceptualisations and measurements of positive contributions within the literature and investigate associated child, parental, family and contextual factors. Method An electronic database search was conducted using Medline, Psycinfo, CINAHL, ERIC and Embase: 94 articles were identified for full text review and 26 studies were selected. The quality of studies were appraised and data were synthesised according to the review aims. Results Positive contributions were conceptualised in nine different ways across selected studies. Ten standardised self-report questionnaires, one unstandardised questionnaire and one closed question were used to measure these constructs. Variables associated with higher positive contributions within this group included older age of child, being of an ethnic minority group, being a mother, higher psychological wellbeing and personal resources, relationship satisfaction, social support and narrative writing. Conclusions This review verified previous reports of positive contributions among parents of children with ASD and highlighted potential areas of support. Strengths and limitations of the studies are highlighted and implications for future research and clinical practice are discussed.","No funding was sourced for the purpose of this research.

Method This report explored the visual processing of individuals with ASD (n = 50) compared with their first-degree relatives (n = 117) using electroencephalogram (EEG), and associated EEG response with specific polymorphisms in the COMT, OXTR, SLC6A4 and DAT1 genes. Results Polymorphisms in the COMT and OXTR genes were not associated with any specific EEG response; on the other hand, the 5-HTTLPR polymorphism located upstream of SLC6A4 was associated with increased latency of the P1 component of the EEG response, and DAT1 genotype correlated with reduced amplitude of the N170 component in male participants with ASD. Conclusion These results suggest an interaction between DAT1 genotype and male participants with ASD characterized by reduced cognitive performance when processing faces as measured by EEG. Identifying ASD functional markers and grouping individuals with shared genetic biomarkers or endophenotypes may facilitate greater understanding of the heterogeneity underlying ASD leading to improved diagnosis and treatment of ASD.",We thank all the families for their participation in this study.

To explore that, we used a Deese-Roediger–McDermott (DRM) false-memory paradigm, known to rely on associative relations between words. We therefore expected people with ASD in our study to be less susceptible to produce false memories. The novelty of this study was to use the externalized free-recall procedure to further explore the dynamics of correct and error responses in ASD. Method Adults with ASD and age- and IQ-matched adults in a comparison group were tested on a DRM task where 12 lists of strongly associated words were presented auditorily. At test, an externalized free-recall procedure was used, requesting participants to report presented words, and also any extra words that came to their mind (generated words). Results As expected, the clinical group produced fewer false memories than the comparison group, potentially due to abnormal relational processing. Moreover, unlike comparison participants, individuals with ASD tended to accept the critical words as belonging to the list rather than as generated, which demonstrates abnormalities in the monitoring capacity underlying an identify-to-reject process. Furthermore, analysis of questionnaires revealed that adults with ASD are less likely than typical adults to use memory strategies at both encoding and retrieval. Conclusions These findings are discussed in relation to the operation of error-inflating and error-editing mechanisms, both of which seem to be compromised in autism.","The contributions of Emiliano Díez, María A.

This review investigated its association with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) characteristics and related social dimensions, both in individuals with and without ASD. Twelve articles investigating OXTR DNAm in relation to ASD, social perception/cognition and social anxiety were included. We found that hypermethylation is associated with (i) higher quantitative autism traits in adults, reflecting a higher incidence of autism characteristics, (ii) increased brain activity while performing social tasks (indicating a higher need for resources) and (iii) decreased functional connectivity. (iv) Contradictory, hypomethylation was found to be present in children (especially boys) with ASD and was also associated with more social anxiety. While the included studies displayed a large variability, for example in terms of population characteristics, analysed OXTR DNAm regions, and adopted scales/questionnaires, an initial developmental pattern of results emerged, suggesting an association between hypermethylation of OXTR and autism traits in adults.

In particular, it reduces clinical symptoms and immunological anomalies in children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD). The present study explored whether the herbal formula can improve executive functions and the associated neuroelectrophysiological activity in ASD. Thirty children with ASD were evenly assigned to receive a daily intranasal administration of the herbal formula or no treatment. Their executive functions, behavioral problems, and electroencephalographic activity during an executive control task were measured before and after six months of treatment with the herbal formula. After treatment, the experimental group showed significantly improved inhibitory control, mental flexibility, and planning, which coincided with an event-related elevation in the activity of their prefrontal and anterior cingulate cortices (regions that are critical for executive control of behaviors) as well as reduced daily dysexecutive behaviors. In contrast, the control group showed no significant changes in executive functions or neural system activity. These findings support the administration of the intranasal herbal medicine as a possible intervention for improving executive functions in ASD.","This study was supported by a donation from Mr. Sau-wang Law to the Chinese University of Hong Kong.

However, emotional self-awareness is labelled and defined differently in various strands of research, and is often measured by self-report. These issues may influence differences in emotional self-awareness between autistic and non-autistic groups. Thus, we need to examine how emotional self-awareness is defined and measured in this literature. Method We systematically reviewed studies comparing emotional self-awareness in autistic and non-autistic participants. Forty-seven papers were identified for inclusion, and how emotional self-awareness was defined was extracted from each. Thematic analysis was conducted on extracted definitions. The measurement tools used in each paper were also reviewed, to assess the extent to which studies are reliant upon self-report. Results We identified seven key themes in definitions of emotional self-awareness, with little consistency. Also, the themes identified mapped poorly onto the tools used to measure them. Most studies relied exclusively on self-report, and few used more than one tool. Only three behavioural measurement tools were identified. Conclusion Emotional self-awareness has been variably defined by researchers in different strands of autism research. Moreover, most studies exclusively use self-report alone to measure this outcome, and this may not be reliable. To account for the multi-faceted nature of emotional self-awareness, future research would benefit from specifically defining which aspect of emotional self-awareness is under study and utilising multi-method approaches.","We would like to sincerely thank all the authors who shared their data with us.

Mental state attribution tasks show that autistic people are less accurate than neurotypicals in attributing an agent’s intention when there is clearly a right answer. Little is known about how autistic people judge the intentionality of ambiguous actions (i.e., actions that are neither clearly intentional nor clearly unintentional). Aims This study sought to find out whether autistic individuals differ in their interpretation of ambiguous action compared to neurotypical controls. Methods and procedures 20 autistic and 20 neurotypical adults completed an ambiguous action and theory of mind task. Autistic traits, verbal reasoning and non-verbal perceptual reasoning ability were measured. Outcomes and results Results show that intentionality endorsement scores for ambiguous but prototypically accidental actions were higher in autistic participants than controls. Theory of Mind (ToM) scores did not correlate with intentionality endorsement scores in either group therefore group differences could not be explained by ToM ability. Conclusion and implications Autistic participants had a tendency to over-attribute intention compared to neurotypicals, which could not be explained by ToM ability. Studying ambiguous action is important with respect to ecological validity, given that we often face ambiguous actions during social encounters.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2022-08,2022,,2022-08,96,,101997,Closed,Article,"Eisenkoeck, Antonia; Slavny-Cross, Rachel J.M.; Moore, James W.","Eisenkoeck, Antonia (Department of Psychology, Goldsmiths, University of London, UK); Slavny-Cross, Rachel J.M.

Recent studies show an increased understanding of students with ASD in higher education. Yet, current research generally relies on small samples, lacks information about student characteristics prior to enrollment, and does not compare students with ASD to other students. Method Background and enrollment characteristics of students with ASD (n = 97) were compared to students with other disabilities (OD; n = 2252) and students with no recorded disabilities (ND; n = 24,794) based on administrative data of first-year bachelor enrollments (n = 27,143). Results From 2010 to 2016 the proportion of students with ASD significantly increased from 0.20% to 0.45%. The characteristics of ASD students at enrollment were similar to other students, but it took ASD students more time to reach higher education compared to ND students, and they were at heightened risk of comorbidity compared to OD students. No difficulties were found with participation in preparatory activities, and goal setting. Conclusions These quantitative insights are a valuable addition to the more qualitative evidence so far. For parents of children with ASD and individuals with ASD, these findings could help to adjust lower expectations. As this kind of administrative data is available to most institutions in higher education in day-to-day information systems, this study is promising for institutions to gain better insights in the enrollment of their students with ASD, and improve transition support.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2019-11,2019,,2019-11,67,,101424,All OA; Hybrid,Article,"Bakker, Theo; Krabbendam, Lydia; Bhulai, Sandjai; Begeer, Sander","Bakker, Theo (Department of Clinical, Neuro- Developmental Psychology, Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands); Krabbendam, Lydia (Department of Clinical, Neuro- Developmental Psychology, Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands); Bhulai, Sandjai (Department of Clinical, Neuro- Developmental Psychology, Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands); Begeer, Sander (Department of Clinical, Neuro- Developmental Psychology, Faculty of Behavioural and Movement Sciences, Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam, the Netherlands)","Bakker, Theo (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)","Bakker, Theo (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Krabbendam, Lydia (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Bhulai, Sandjai (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam); Begeer, Sander (Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam)",Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam,grid.12380.38,Netherlands,,22,16,,7.68,14,https://doi.org/10.1016/j.rasd.2019.101424,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1120005637,52 Psychology; 5201 Applied and Developmental Psychology; 5203 Clinical and Health Psychology,4 Quality Education,No,,,

Method The present study examined the occurrence of (1) psychiatric diagnoses obtained before autism was diagnosed, (2) psychiatric conditions co-occurring with autism following its diagnosis, and (3) psychiatric conditions that were diagnosed before autism but no longer co-occurred with autism following its diagnosis. Participants (N = 1019, 51.5% female) provided information on psychiatric conditions predating their diagnosis of autism and psychiatric conditions co-occurring with autism. This information was combined to identify prior diagnoses that were no longer present post-autism diagnosis. Results Results showed that 50.2% of participants (62.7% of females and 37% of males) had at least one prior diagnosis. Mood and personality disorders were the most frequent prior diagnoses. Moreover, 59.3% (67% of females and 51% of males) reported having at least one diagnosis co-occurring with autism. Mood and anxiety disorders were the most frequent co-occurring diagnoses. Finally, 37.7% (47% of females and 27.3% of males) reported at least one previously diagnosed psychiatric condition that was no longer listed as a condition co-occurring with autism following its diagnosis. Personality disorders were most frequently no longer reported as diagnoses co-occurring with autism, despite being listed as prior diagnoses.

Several studies have explored the association between ASD and FA, but the conclusions were inconsistent. The aim of this review was to evaluate the relationship between ASD and FA. The PubMed, Embase, and Web of Science databases were searched from inception to February 2, 2020. Studies investigating the association between ASD and FA were included. A random effects model was used to pool risk estimates. Subgroup analysis and sensitivity analysis were used to explore the potential sources of heterogeneity. Fifteen studies with a total of 293,130 participants were included in this review. The pooled prevalence of FA in individuals with ASD was 13% (95% confidence interval (CI): 0.10–0.17), while the pooled prevalence of FA in controls was 5% (95% CI: 0.04–0.07). The pooled odds ratio (OR) for FA in individuals with ASD was 2.45 (95% CI: 2.25–2.67). One study examined the prevalence of ASD in participants with FA. The prevalence of ASD in individuals with FA was 3.5% (95% CI: 0.029–0.042), while the prevalence of ASD in the control group was 1.6% (95% CI: 0.015–0.017). Five study examined the OR of ASD in participants with FA. The OR for ASD in individuals with FA was 1.95 (95% CI: 1.73–2.19). The results of this systematic review and meta‐analysis seem to reveal a significant association between ASD and FA. This systematic review and meta‐analysis evaluate the relationship between ASD and FA. We found that the prevalence of FA was higher in participants with ASD than in controls and participants with ASD were at risk of developing FA and the prevalence of ASD was higher in participants with FA than in controls and participants with FA were at risk of developing ASD.

The current review extends previous syntheses of literature related to support systems for students with ASD in higher education, as well as their first-hand experiences. Method This review systematically considered experiences of students with ASD in higher education and supports offered to them in both academic and non-academic realms as reported by students themselves. Of the 2,354 screened studies, 24 met inclusion criteria for review. Results Students with ASD experience high rates of mental health issues, sensory challenges, and social, academic, and communication difficulties. Academic supports, which were infrequently reported, include tutoring, accommodations, and coursework modifications. Non-academic supports included social skills training, peer-mediated interventions, counseling, and other university disability services. Although available, these supports may not be fully utilized due to students’ nondisclosure of their ASD diagnosis. Conclusions Non-academic supports for students with ASD are increasing along with this population’s enrollment in higher education, yet the development of academic supports appears to be less prevalent. These findings suggest institutions of higher education focus on the development and accessibility of academic supports, and additionally, provide faculty and staff with effective professional development to address the stigmatization of seeking out and utilizing available support systems.",No grant funding was used to fund this research.

Cygnet is a parenting intervention which aims to help parents address these difficulties, consequently improving parenting confidence. It is widely used in the United Kingdom (UK). Despite this, there have been few evaluations. This paper reports a small-scale pragmatic evaluation of Cygnet as it was routinely delivered in two English cities. A non-randomised controlled study of outcomes for parents (and their children) was conducted. Data regarding intervention fidelity and delivery costs were also collected. Parents either attending, or waiting to attend, Cygnet were recruited (intervention group: IG, n=35; comparator group: CG, n=32). Parents completed standardised measures of child behaviour and parenting sense of competence pre- and post-intervention, and at three-month follow-up (matched time points for CG). Longer-term outcomes were measured for the IG. IG parents also set specific child behaviour goals. Typically, the programme was delivered as specified by the manual. Attending Cygnet was associated with significant improvements in parenting satisfaction and the specific child behaviour goals. Findings regarding other outcomes were equivocal and further evaluation is required. We conclude that Cygnet is a promising intervention for parents of children with autism in terms of, at least, some outcomes.",The research reported here was commissioned by the Centre for Excellence and Outcomes (C4EO) with funding from the Department for Education (DfE 2494).

Researchers have most often used single case designs, a type of design appropriate for evaluating causal relations, to assess feeding interventions. Previous reviews of effectiveness have included only peer-reviewed studies (e.g., did not include gray literature) and have not analyzed outcomes via the presence of functional relations, the primary analysis method for single case research. Method Authors reviewed peer-reviewed and non-peer-reviewed sources including studies designed to improve mealtime behaviors for individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD) to determine participant characteristics, common intervention characteristics and components, and success rates (percentage of studies with functional relations). Results Studies often included individuals with ASD who were highly selective; common dependent variables were acceptance of food and problematic mealtime behaviors. Researchers, rather than indigenous adults, most often implemented studies in clinics, rather than typical settings. Interventions designed to improve acceptance had higher success rates (percentage of studies demonstrating a functional relation) than those targeting rumination/vomiting or problematic mealtime behavior. Conclusions Outcomes were more often positive for food acceptance and less often positive for problematic mealtime behavior. More research is needed, particularly in typical contexts with indigenous implementers and including component analyses, feasibility assessment, and social validity measurement.

The use of a structured instrument during evaluation of these children can reduce the risk of hindered detection. The aims of the current studies were to establish the extent of school-based professionals’ involvement in detecting autism and to replicate earlier findings of autism detection amongst school mentors. Results showed that school-based professionals were reported to be the first to suspect autistic features in 20% of children later diagnosed with autism. Additionally, school-based professionals refer to autism more often when judging children from majority than children from minority groups. However, using a structured instrument did not eliminate this bias. Providing these professionals with culture-sensitive education may help maximise their involvement in detecting autism amongst children from all ethnic backgrounds.","Firstly we would like to thank the ZonMW for funding this study (grant number: 417100003).

Despite reliability of most autism diagnoses by age 24 months, the majority of children with autism do not receive comprehensive evaluations until after age 36 months. Although many possible reasons exist for delayed evaluations, the referral decision process itself is not clearly defined nor understood. In particular, little is known about how perceptions of early childhood symptoms of ASD interact with decision criteria to ultimately refer a child for comprehensive diagnostic assessment. Method To better understand pre-referral perceptions and decision factors involved, we provided multiple video clips from early comprehensive autism evaluations as prompts, then asked early childhood clinicians and educators (n = 346) to make decisions about autism referral, then to identify factors considered when making decisions. Results Decision factors cited most often were play, social interactions/engagement, and verbal behaviors, but none were cited by a clear majority. Some important early signs were infrequently mentioned: absence of joint attention, social reciprocity and gestures. Accuracy of referral decisions was similar across disciplines, indicating a broad range of professionals capable of identifying early signs of autism. Conclusions Autism training across early childhood professional disciplines should emphasize importance of early signs involving significant absences of behaviors, such as low joint attention, gestures, and social reciprocity in addition to odd social, verbal, and play behaviors.

The focus on embodiment in autism research forges a link between psychosocial deficits and sensory motor challenges. Further, sensory motor actions and experiences are the foundation for cognition, emotions and communication within conceptualizations of embodiment. This unifies theoretical divisions between body and mind. This shift of perspective raises the question of whether or not there is a gap between emergent research knowledge and its implementation in practice. Thus, the aim of this scoping review was to understand the extent of research on interventions focused on the use of sensory motor based or movement based interventions (MBI) to target psychosocial outcomes for children with autism. Using a combination of a descriptive numerical analysis and a thematic analysis of fourteen studies, this scoping review provides the preliminary evidence of the efficacy of MBIs for children with ASD and questions actual research practices to measure psychosocial changes.","We acknowledge Jill Boruff, librarian, for her support and contribution in the database searches.",Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2016-04,2016,,2016-04,24,,52-67,Closed,Article,"Lee, Keven; Lambert, Heather; Wittich, Walter; Kehayia, Eva; Park, Melissa","Lee, Keven (School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of the Greater Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); Lambert, Heather (School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); Wittich, Walter (School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of the Greater Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; School of Optometry, University of Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada); Kehayia, Eva (School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of the Greater Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Jewish Rehabilitation Hospital, Laval, Quebec, Canada); Park, Melissa (School of Physical and Occupational Therapy, Faculty of Medicine, McGill University, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation of the Greater Montreal, Montreal, Quebec, Canada; Lady Davis Institute, Jewish General Hospital, Montreal, Quebec, Canada)","Lee, Keven (McGill University; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation)","Lee, Keven (McGill University; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation); Lambert, Heather (McGill University); Wittich, Walter (McGill University; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation; University of Montreal); Kehayia, Eva (McGill University; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation; Jewish Rehabilitation Hospital); Park, Melissa (McGill University; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation; Jewish General Hospital)",Jewish Rehabilitation Hospital; University of Montreal; McGill University; Centre for Interdisciplinary Research in Rehabilitation; Jewish General Hospital,grid.414993.2; grid.14848.31; grid.14709.3b; grid.420709.8; grid.414980.0,Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada; Canada,,9,3,,1.45,2,,https://app.dimensions.ai/details/publication/pub.1029186097,52 Psychology; 5204 Cognitive and Computational Psychology,,No,,,

For parents and clinicians, the possibility of using the first vocal productions as prognostic indications has been tempting. However, such an approach implies questions of predictability and the development of language. To describe and analyze certain relationships between phonological and lexical development with the aim of determining a simple prognostic indicator, 60 children were observed twice, at 5 years of age (T1) and three years later (T2). Linguistic data were obtained in a semi-standardized situation (ADOS-G) and from parents (ADI-R, Item 19), and analyzed with CHILDES. At T1, the sample was distributed into a ‘verbal’ and a ‘non-verbal’ group. From T1 to T2, the sample replicated the four trajectories known from pathological development characterized by stability, progression and regression. A multiple regression analysis for predicting morpheme production at T2 showed that two general markers (CARS and DLS, being ‘risk factors’) and one specific marker (phoneme production, a ‘protection’ factor) were significantly related to lexical development.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2011-07,2011,,2011-07,5,3,1243-1252,Closed,Article,"Pry, René; Petersen, Arne F.; Baghdadli, A.

Increasingly, it is recognised that there is a spectrum of severity of excessive mistrust across the general population. Relatively little is known about paranoia in individuals with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), but rates could be expected to be higher given both difficulties in understanding others’ mental states and frequent experiences of negative social interactions. A systematic search of English-language peer-reviewed publications was undertaken to synthesise empirical research about paranoia in ASD. Seven studies, comprising a total of 180 ASD participants, met the inclusion criteria. All the studies were cross-sectional, thereby limiting causal interpretations. Individuals with ASD were consistently found to have higher levels of paranoia compared to non-clinical controls, and lower levels than individuals with current psychotic experiences manifesting in the context of schizophrenia. Furthermore, the initial evidence indicates that paranoia in ASD may be linked with theory of mind performance, negative affect, and jumping to conclusions, but not to attributional style. As in typically-developing populations, causal and maintaining mechanisms for paranoia in ASD, against a background of genetic and environmental risk, most likely include cognitive and affective processes interacting with social factors. We hypothesise, however, that core ASD characteristics and associated neurocognitive impairments also serve to precipitate and perpetuate paranoia. A framework to guide further investigation is outlined.","DS is funded by a National Institute for Health Research (NIHR) Clinical Doctoral Research Fellowship (CDRF–2012–03–059).

Autism spectrum traits are related to cortical thickness differences in both autism and typical development,"Autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is a complex neurodevelopmental disorder characterized by impairments in communication and social interaction, as well as repetitive behaviors and interests. However, these traits are highly variable across individuals with ASD and are also present in the typically developing population. Brain structural correlates of ASD are also heterogeneous. Recent findings have indicated that ASD traits as measured by the autism quotient (AQ) are reflected in white matter structural differences in a continuous way across both typically-developed and ASD individuals. Here, we tested for the first time, how ASD traits are related to gray matter structural differences (and particularly cortical thickness) in both ASD and typically developing adults. The present results show that ASD traits are primarily correlated with reductions in cortical thickness in a continuous fashion across ASD and typically developing adults in social brain areas and the default mode network including the orbitofrontal cortex, postcentral gyrus, and lingual gyrus. These findings provide new evidence that ASD traits are primarily reflected in neural structure that exists along a continuum extending into the typically developing population.","This work was supported by the Danish Ministry of Science and Innovation (10-093462, L.G.) and the Lundbeck Foundation (R32-A2846, L.G.).",Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2015-05,2015,,2015-05,13,,Aug-14,Closed,Article,"Gebauer, Line; Foster, Nicholas E.V.; Vuust, Peter; Hyde, Krista L.","Gebauer, Line (Center of Functionally Integrative Neuroscience, Aarhus University, Denmark; Interacting Minds Centre, Aarhus University, Denmark; Department of Psychology and behavioral sciences, Aarhus University, Denmark); Foster, Nicholas E.V.

Children who experience ASD often also experience sensory processing difficulties, yet, a gap in the evidence remains regarding the use of sensory assessments specifically with infants and children with ASD aged 0–12 years. To address this gap and given that children in this age group typically move through three levels of education during these years, a scoping review was conducted. Method The scoping review reviewed the peer-reviewed literature since 2008 in order to identify research that examined the use of sensory assessments with children with ASD aged 0–12. Seven databases were used. Results Of the 37 articles included in this review, and 12 sensory assessments were identified. Three themes emerged: (a) administration, (b) focus and content, and, (c) reliability and validity. Conclusions The findings suggest that additional research is necessary given the diversity in assessments and their application to the target population. Considering the available evidence, it is difficult to identify which is/are the most appropriate, psychometrically-sound assessment(s) when assessing sensory processing with this population. As assessments are administered in different ways; appear to capture slightly different sensory modalities and concepts related to sensory processing; and given that the psychometric properties of some assessments are poor to moderate, it is suggested that health professionals interpret sensory assessment findings with caution. It is also recommended that health professionals utilise a variety of sensory assessments.","Ms Heather Davey, Monash Health, Clayton, Victoria, Australia, 3168 – assisted by providing insight and background into the topic.

Parents assessed the development of 8540 children quarterly for three years on five orthogonal subscales: combinatorial receptive language, expressive language, sociability, sensory awareness, and health. 57% of caregivers reported no sleep problems, 31% reported mild sleep problems, 10% reported moderate sleep problems, and 2% reported severe sleep problems. In order to investigate the effect of sleep problems, children with moderate and severe sleep problems (N = 651) were matched to those with no sleep problems using a propensity score based on age, gender, expressive language, combinatorial receptive language, sociability, sensory awareness, and health at the 1st evaluation. There were 643 matched participants in each group. Children with no sleep problems developed faster compared to matched children with sleep problems in all subscales. The greatest difference in trajectories was detected in the health subscale. When controlling for the health score (in addition to each subscale score at baseline as well as gender and ASD severity), the effect of sleep problems decreased in all subscales except the combinatorial receptive language subscale (where the effect of sleep problems was increased), suggesting that sleep problems affect combinatorial language acquisition regardless of the overall health. This study confirms a high prevalence of sleep problems in autistic children and provides information on the effect of sleep problems on various aspects of children’s development.",We wish to thank all participants’ caregivers who courageously fight for their children’s intellect and found time to complete quarterly assessments.

Several medical conditions including gastrointestinal (GI) problems, asthma and allergies have been associated with ASD, and multiple risk factors, both genetic and environmental, have been proposed. Among them, vitamin D (VD) deficiency is probably associated with ASD, and may play a role in the condition.We conducted a systematic review of the literature for the period January 1, 2010 through June 15, 2014, according to PRISMA guidelines, aiming to investigate the complex biological interplay between VD, metabolism, immune system and nervous system in ASD.Different trends in the association between ASD and VD deficiency have been observed, and factors such as gender, ethnicity, sampling, and methodology play a role in the results and outcomes.At present, for at least a subgroup of ASD individuals, an imbalance in VD metabolism probably exists and may be associated with the condition. In this cohort, VD replacement in these individuals might contribute to improving ASD symptoms and/or associated conditions.

However, there remains a significant gap between research and practice. We explored the similarities and differences between educators and allied health professionals in two key factors that may link to uptake: individual attitudes and organizational culture support for EBP. Method Allied health (n = 156) and education professionals (n = 95) completed measures of their individual attitudes and perceived organizational support for EBP. Results Moderate levels of support for each were found within both groups. Educators however, showed more positive individual attitudes, whereas allied health professionals showed more positive organizational support toward EBP. Conclusions These results add to the scant literature comparing professions, highlighting discipline differences in attitudes and organizational support across professionals for EBP in autism.

A co-occurring diagnosis of intellectual disability (ID) is common among children on the autism spectrum, with ID itself impacting caregiver outcomes. Method This study sought to understand how co-occurring ID in children on the autism spectrum may influence caregiver-related outcomes. Secondary analysis of survey data from caregivers of 278 children on the autism spectrum with (n = 62) and without (n = 216) co-occurring ID was conducted, exploring impacts on caregiver QoL, stress, coping, and time-use. Results Univariate analysis showed that caregivers of children on the autism spectrum with co-occurring ID reported greater levels of stress due to core symptoms and co-occurring physical conditions, and had different time use patterns then caregivers of children on the autism spectrum without co-occurring ID. Multivariate analysis, however, showed that caregivers of children on the autism spectrum with and without co-occurring ID differed only in the time they spent preparing meals, socialising with friends and accessing in-home respite care. Conclusions The presence of co-occurring ID in children on the autism spectrum had limited impacts on caregiver-related outcomes.

In addition, anxiety in autistic adults is associated with poorer quality of life and myriad negative outcomes (e.g., unemployment, suicidality). Therefore, this systematic review aimed to summarize and evaluate the literature on the psychotherapeutic and psychopharmacological treatment of anxiety in autistic adults to inform clinical decision-making. Method Several online databases were searched for peer-reviewed journal articles with any combination of the following terms in the abstract: (1) autism, autistic, Asperger, Asperger’s, or “pervasive developmental disorder” (2) anxiety, anxious, phobia, mutism, panic, agoraphobia, or worry and (3) treatment, intervention, trial, therapy, psychotherapy, pharmacotherapy, medication, drug, antidepressant, sedative, or anti-anxiety. Data were extracted from articles meeting the inclusion criteria, and the strength of the evidence was assessed for treatments. Results Fifteen psychosocial treatment studies, one pharmacological treatment study, and one combined psychosocial and pharmacological treatment study met the inclusion criteria. The most investigated treatment for anxiety in adults with ASD was cognitive behavioral therapy (CBT). Conclusions Few studies have investigated the treatment of anxiety in autistic adults. Additionally, findings have been inconsistent across studies regarding the potential effectiveness of particular psychosocial and pharmacological treatments.

In the experiment, 10 AS adults (2 females, age 19.6±1.96) and 10 IQ-matched controls (3 females, age 24.4±3.24) participated in tasks involving emotionality evaluation of either photograph or line-drawing faces. Emotional faces elicited comparable reaction times and evaluation scores between the two groups. In the photograph task, the AS group had no visible N400 component and lower delta/theta synchronization (350–450ms post-stimulus onset) in the temporal and occipital–parietal regions, and much weaker phase synchronization between distant scalp regions (200–500ms post-stimulus onset) compared with the control group. In the line-drawing task, the two groups had the same degree of delta/theta synchronization in the central and occipital–parietal regions and comparable phase synchronization between scalp regions. We conclude by hypothesizing that AS patients might have structural deficits in the amygdala and its related limbic structures, a site critical for recognition of emotional faces beyond conscious awareness, but that they preserve the intact function in the cognitive pathway to keep up comparable behavioral performances with the healthy controls through voluntary control of attention.",This research was supported by grants NSC101-2811-H-001-020 and NSC101-2410-H-001-032.,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2015-05,2015,,2015-05,13,,32-51,Closed,Article,"Tseng, Yi-Li; Yang, Han Hsuan; Savostyanov, Alexander N.; Chien, Vincent S.C.; Liou, Michelle","Tseng, Yi-Li (Institute of Statistical Science, Academia Sinica, Taipei 115, Taiwan; Department of Electrical Engineering, Fu Jen Catholic University, New Taipei City 24205, Taiwan); Yang, Han Hsuan (Institute of Psychology, Fo Guang University, Jiaosi, Yilan County 26247, Taiwan); Savostyanov, Alexander N.

A JA induction experiment was performed in which children with ASD (N=16) and matched TD children (N=16) had a 3-min interaction with the robot or with a therapist. Nao induced JA by gazing; by gazing and pointing; and by gazing, pointing and vocalizing at pictures. Both groups of children performed well with the therapist. However, with Nao, both groups had lower JA scores, and the children with ASD had a significantly lower score than the TD children. We found that (i) multimodal JA induction was more efficient in both groups; (ii) the 3D spatial world gaze exploration showed less accuracy; and (iii) the trunk position in ASD showed less stability in the 4 dimensions compared to TD controls.We conclude that, in ASD, JA skill depends on the interaction partner, and implies a higher motor and cognitive cost.","The authors would like to thank all of the patients and families who participated in the current study.

There have been no randomised trials investigating low-intensity psychological interventions for mild-moderate depression adapted for autistic adults. Method This qualitative evaluation investigated the acceptability of the ADEPT pilot randomised controlled trial (RCT) design and guided self-help intervention. Participants (autistic adults with a diagnosis of depression (PHQ-9 score ≥ 10)) were randomised to Guided Self-Help (GSH): low intensity psychological intervention based on Behavioural Activation adapted for autistic adults, or Treatment as Usual (TAU). 21 trial participants (14 GSH and 7 TAU), and 5 low intensity psychological therapists or ‘coaches’ were interviewed, and transcripts analysed thematically. Results All participants and coaches welcomed an intervention for depression adapted for autistic adults due to current lack of provision in mainstream services. Interviews highlighted participants' preference for GSH over TAU. Dissatisfaction with prior experience of TAU was identified as a potential driver for differential attrition from the TAU arm. Participants who received GSH appreciated the coaches having a good understanding of autistic adults and were positive towards the aim and structure of the GSH intervention. Suggested improvements include more regularly checking progress with therapy goals. Conclusions A full scale RCT to evaluate the effectiveness of this intervention is now warranted. Future trial study design needs to address potential for differential rate of participant recruitment and attrition between the treatment and comparison groups due to negative prior experience of TAU.","The authors thank all who took part in this study.

Method MEDLINE, EMBASE and Pubmed were searched for studies measuring androgens in mother or child during pregnancy or the first year of life and examined autistic behaviours (including social ability and repetitive behaviour) and language measured up to age 24 years. Results Twenty-five of 3,041 publications met inclusion criteria, exploring 11 unique cohorts. Overall quality of evidence was very low as studies were non-experimental and most had high risk of bias. Only one research group found significant associations between autistic behaviour and androgens in amniotic fluid. There were mixed findings across the studies reviewed. Meta-analysis indicated a small significant pooled association between autistic behaviour and androgens in amniotic fluid (males and females combined; 3 studies), 0.28 [95 % CI 0.14, 0.41], also significant in males and females separately. Conclusions Despite interest in this topic, of studies exploring direct measures of early androgens and later autistic traits, there is only a small amount of low-quality evidence from independent cohorts.

Method Participants were 258 mother-father dyads and their child. Parents provided demographic information and completed measures on their parenting stress and their child’s autism symptom severity. Results Partial correlations revealed that, at the time of diagnosis, after controlling for children’s age and autism symptom severity, mothers’ and fathers’ stress was positively and significantly associated with each other, suggesting a bidirectional relation between partners’ psychological adjustment. Cross-lagged panel analyses demonstrated different longitudinal and transactional links, depending on the dimension of stress examined.

However, no review has yet assessed mean change across a range of measures, or described the longitudinal heterogeneity of ATs, i.e. variation in direction and degree of change. Method A systematic literature review was conducted using PubMed, PsycINFO and EMBASE up to May 31 2020. Forty-four studies meeting inclusion criteria were identified. Results Retrieved studies ranged from N = 20 to N = 9,744. Ages spanned one to 15 years at baseline and two to 23 years at follow-up. The proportion of female participants per study ranged from 0 to 51%. There is some evidence that overall ATs tend to reduce over time for autistic children, reflecting decreases in social communication difficulties but not restricted behaviours. This effect was strongest in clinical samples and using parent-report measures. However, there was good evidence that statistics of mean change obscure between-person differences in within-person change. Decreasing ATs appear linked to higher verbal and non-verbal IQ and female gender in autistic participants. Four patterns of change: increasing, decreasing and stable high and low best characterised the data. Conclusions Individuals experience diverse patterns of change over time. More general population studies are needed to reduce male bias. More work is needed to characterise the relationship between trajectories and well-being, functioning and quality of life outcomes.

Reading performance is similar for the two groups in both languages. While reading Mandarin Chinese, the control group showed a left-hemispheric specialization within the 400–600ms interval in delta synchronization. However, delta synchronizations were widely distributed in all scalp regions and lasted longer than 600ms in the AS group. One possible interpretation of our data is the hypothesis that the AS group has more difficulty in brain organization of semantic and syntactic processes than the control group when reading their native language, because Chinese syntactic structure requires more work to be done by the perceiver. Nevertheless, other brain mechanisms (e.g., top-down regulation), can partially compensate for this difficulty, allowing AS subjects to attain the same level of response activity as the controls.","This research was supported by grants NSC96-2413-H-001-001-MY3, NSC99-2410-H-001-104-MY3, and NSC100-2811-H-001-005 from the National Science Council (Taiwan).",Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2013-07,2013,,2013-07,7,7,889-905,Closed,Article,"Tsai, Arthur C.; Savostyanov, Alexander N.; Wu, Alan; Evans, Jonathan P.; Chien, Vincent S.C.; Yang, Han-Hsuan; Yang, Dong-Yu; Liou, Michelle","Tsai, Arthur C.

We tested whether this anomaly arises because comprehension studies have focused on manipulating perspective-taking at a ‘generic speaker’ level. Method We compared 24 autistic eight- to eleven-year-old with 24 well-matched neuro-typical controls. Children interpreted requests (e.g. ‘Can I have that ball?’) in contexts which would be ambiguous (i.e. because the child can see two balls) if perspective-taking were not utilized. In the interlocutor-specific perspective-taking condition, the target was the particular object which was new for the speaker. Children needed to take into account what the speaker had played with before and the fact that they were now expressing excitement about something new. In two control ‘speaker-generic’ conditions we tested children’s ability to take the visual perspective of the speaker (where any speaker who stood behind a particular barrier would have the same perspective). Results The autistic group were significantly less likely to select the target and significantly more likely to request clarification in the ‘interlocutor-specific’ condition. Performance in the ‘interlocutor-generic’ (visual) perspective taking conditions did not differ between groups. Conclusion Autistic children, even those who are not intellectually-impaired, tend to have more difficulty than neuro-typical peers in comprehending referring expressions when this requires understanding that people comment on what is new for them.","The authors are grateful to the families, schools and children that participated, including those recruited via the Kent Child Development Unit and via the Kent Autistic Trust.

This study aimed to systematically examine the efficacy of psychosocial and pharmacological treatments for depression in youth and adults with ASD to inform clinical practice. Method PsycINFO, PubMed, and CINAHL online databases were searched for peer-reviewed journal articles containing any combination of the following terms in the abstract: (1) autism, autistic, Asperger, or “pervasive developmental disorder,” (2) depression or depressive and (3) treatment, intervention, trial, therapy, medication, drug, or antidepressant. Evidence from studies meeting the predetermined criteria of inclusion was assessed for its strength to inform clinical decision-making. Results Twenty psychosocial treatment studies and five pharmacological treatment studies met the criteria of inclusion. Psychosocial interventions studied the effectiveness of cognitive remediation therapy, behavioral therapy, cognitive-behavioral therapy (CBT), combined psychosocial intervention, mindfulness-based therapy (MBT), and social, academic, and/or vocational skills training. Pharmacological interventions studied the effectiveness of anti-epileptic drug, norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor, stimulant, atypical antipsychotic, and NMDA receptor antagonist treatment. Conclusions Although much recent research has investigated potentially effective treatments for depression in individuals with ASD, the strength of the evidence remains generally poor. However, studies indicate preliminary efficacy for MBT. A number of investigations have examined the effect of CBT on depression in persons with ASD; however, the results are inconsistent. Further research is needed to advance clinical practice for individuals with ASD and comorbid depression.","The authors thank Jacob Boomgaardt, DO, and Peter D.

Misinformation and easy access to ineffective treatments complicates the decision-making process for parents. Research on implicit factors (e.g., parent or child characteristics) and declared factors (e.g., parent-reported reasons) contributes to an understanding of what influences these decisions. Method The aim of this systematic review was to examine the significance of factors associated with treatment selection. The review was conducted in accordance with the PRISMA protocol. Results The search revealed 51 studies which contained data on implicit and/or declared factors associated with treatment selection. The data were tabulated by factor and synthesised. The severity of a child’s behavioural problems, parental stress, and parent beliefs about ASD were consistently identified as implicit factors associated with the use of particular treatments. A wide range of reasons for treatment choices were declared by parent respondents, including; the individual needs of their child, recommendations from others, practical reasons (e.g., cost), child age, hope for recovery, hope for improvement, and concerns about side-effects. Conclusion A better understanding of these factors will inform targeted educational approaches which encourage evidence-based practice and a more informed view of treatments not yet supported by research.","The first author (M.

The combined expression of three closely related features: sensory hyperresponsiveness, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and anxiety, may be a sign to practitioners that experiences in the environment are particularly challenging. These are investigated through many approaches, including animal modelling, neurological or physiological measures, behavioral observation, and first-hand accounts. However, little work has been done to review evidence across approaches to better understand their expression. Method This study was an integrated systematic review to identify factors that contribute to the collective expression of three constructs of interests (COIs; hyperresponsiveness, restricted interests and repetitive behaviors, and anxiety). Twenty-two articles were analyzed for both structural and thematic patterns. This review is unique in its inclusion of articles from a variety of disciplines and grouping of studies based on similarities over methodological techniques (i.e. quantitative, qualitative, or mixed methods). Results Three overall structural approaches relating the constructs of interest were identified (parallel, relational, and contingent). Three overarching themes also emerged: 1) the broader social context, 2) predictability of environmental factors, and 3) overlap with cognitive and behavioral coping strategies. Conclusions Results highlight clinically relevant information about the combined expression of the three COIs and demonstrate possibilities for increased collaboration across disciplines through common themes and study structures to further understand the experiences of autistic people.",We would like to thank Jennifer Walker for her assistance on the literature search for this review.,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2021-05,2021,,2021-05,83,,101763,Closed,Article,"Williams, Kathryn L.; Campi, Emily; Baranek, Grace T.","Williams, Kathryn L.

Difficulties with dialogue may reflect impairment in interpersonal engagement more than general language ability.MethodWe investigated conversational abilities among children and adolescents with and without autism (n=18 per group) matched for language proficiency and productivity. Videotaped conversations from the Autism Diagnostic Observational Schedule (ADOS, Lord, Rutter, DiLavore, & Risi, 2001) were rated according to the Collaborative Competence in Dialogue (CCD) scale featuring six verbal and non-verbal ‘cues’ that conversational partners use to sustain dialogue.ResultsParticipants with autism produced significantly fewer ‘typical’ communicative cues and more cues rated as intermittent or rote/stereotyped, even when non-verbal items (gaze) were removed from consideration. Within the autism group, competence in dialogue was not correlated with ‘general’ language ability, but was correlated with a measure of pragmatic ability.ConclusionsDifficulties with collaboration in dialogue may mirror the intermittent or incomplete interpersonal engagement of children with autism.ImplicationsAssessment of language ability in autism should include observation in unstructured social settings.","This research was completed as part of an MSc project by the first author, and was partially supported by the Baily Thomas Charitable Fund: Dialogic aspects of language disability in autism, to the second and third authors of the study.

They indicate non-present referents by gesturing those referents in the same locations as the previous gestures for the same referents (spatially-consistent referent-identifying gestures). We examined whether children with autism spectrum disorders (ASD), whose gesture development is slow, produce this kind of gesture in two circumstances: (1) demonstration task in which they had to follow experimenters’ established referents and spatial locations; and (2) spoken narrative task in which they created their own referents and locations.MethodSchool-aged children with ASD and typically-developing children (TD) demonstrated daily-life activities after the experimenter had orally described and gestured the spatial locations of non-present objects involved (demonstration task) and enacted the characters of a story from a picture (spoken narrative task).ResultsASD children produced fewer spatially-consistent referent-identifying gestures than TD children in the demonstration task. When not following experimenter’s locations, they established their own gestural locations and kept them consistent. They produced a comparable number of spatially-consistent referent-identifying gestures to their TD counterparts in the spoken narrative task. The ability to produce spatially-consistent referent-identifying gestures was negatively correlated to communication and social interaction skills in the demonstration task in both groups. However, such relationship was not found in the spoken narrative task in ASD children.ConclusionASD children have the ability to use consistent gestural locations to represent referents, but this ability may be limited when they have to follow others’ perspectives. Communication and social interaction abilities are crucial when taking others’ perspectives.","This research has been fully supported by grants from the Chinese University of Hong Kong (Project no.

Method This systematic review sought to characterize the range of services received by students with ASD in school settings; identify individual, family, and program factors associated with receipt of specific services; and identify relationships between services and individual, family or program factors to reveal potential systematic differences and disparities. Article identification involved Keyword searches in ERIC and PsycINFO, abstract. and full text review. Data extraction included basic publication details, school-based services, factors measured across the services examined, type of analysis, service-related results, and study demographics. Results In total, 487 articles were screened and reviewed, resulting in 36 eligible articles. Only one study (3 %) used mixed methodology, while all others used quantitative methodology (97 %, n = 35). Youth clinical characteristics by service type was the most frequently examined factor by service characteristic (58 %, n = 21), followed by youth demographics with service type (36 %, n = 13), family demographics by service type (33 %, n = 12), and youth clinical characteristics by service attributes (33 %, n = 12). The majority of reviewed studies explored differences by student race/ethnicity. Conclusions This systematic review identifies determinants of disparities for school-based services for ASD. Findings from this review serve as a first step in developing targeted implementation efforts to reduce disparities in school-based ASD services.",,Research in Autism Spectrum Disorders,,"1750-9467, 1878-0237",,2021-07,2021,,2021-07,85,,101791,Closed,Article,"Suhrheinrich, Jessica; Root, Brittney V.; Melgarejo, Melina; Dickson, Kelsey; Vejnoska, Sarah; Reith, Sarah R.","Suhrheinrich, Jessica (San Diego State University, Department of Special Education, United States; Child and Adolescent Services Research Center, United States); Root, Brittney V.

Our interest stemmed from the idea that malfunctioning cognitive inhibition may contribute to symptoms such as thought perseverance and inflexibility of social interactions in this disorder. Method We drew from work in retrieval-induced forgetting which shows that retrieving items from memory causes forgetting of other competing information. We tested individuals with ASD (n = 19) and without ASD (n = 20) using a task whereby engaging in episodic future thinking (EFT) reduces the subsequent retrievability of related autobiographical memories (AMs). We also looked at a sample of AM and EFT narratives using an overall-richness measure expressed by a quantitative experiential index. Results Although adults with autism showed overall lower levels of richness in their AM and EFT productions, and contrary to our prediction, they demonstrated levels of memory inhibition that were comparable to controls. Conclusions The results suggest that memory inhibition, as measured by EFT-induced forgetting, is relatively intact in ASD and are discussed in terms of how automatic and effortful inhibitory processes in autism might be differentially affected.","The contributions of Dominika Z.

People with intellectual disability often have undiagnosed co-occurring ASD, due to the specific diagnostic challenges that having intellectual disability can present. Screening tools can be useful to indicate those who are likely to require full diagnostic assessment of ASD. Method We conducted a systematic review of the literature. The databases ProQuest, PsycArticles, PubMed, and Web of Science were searched for articles published before July 2019. When duplicates were removed 3068 articles were retained. Articles were removed in stages and were retained if there was a possibility that the content was relevant. In total, 14 articles were reviewed fully. Results The articles covered eight ASD screening instruments and were reviewed in respect of the quality of the available reliability and validity data when used with people with intellectual disability.
