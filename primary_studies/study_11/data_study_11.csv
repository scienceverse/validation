It is essential that transport infrastructures are protected against events which cause their failure. At an optimal level of protection, the sum of protection costs and expected residual damages following from disruptions will be minimized. In most cases however, this optimal level is not achieved because infrastructure protection is susceptible to various market and government failures. This brings us to the question who (a private or public actor) should do how much (the level of protection and intervention). This question is addressed in the present paper. The starting point of the paper is the Directive of the European Council on the identification and designation of European Critical Infrastructures. We review the protection of critical waterborne transport infrastructures from an economic perspective. The review is based on a literature study and several interviews with Critical Infrastructure experts. For the studied infrastructures, we have identified causes and effects of their failure and examined the private‚Äìpublic roles in protecting them. Considering the market and government failures which occur in such configuration of roles, we propose several changes. We conclude that from a national policy perspective there are two important routes: (1) reinforcement of private sector roles among others by defining liabilities and providing information on risks and (2) strengthening of supra-national collaboration via improving and standardizing regulations, cost-sharing initiatives and penalty systems.",Transport Reviews,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Purpose: This study aims to examine the relationships between three styles of conflict management [cooperative conflict management (COP), competitive conflict management (COM) and avoidance conflict management (AVO)], the subjective relational experience, perceived insider status, organization-based self-esteem and employees‚Äô service innovation behavior in the airline industry. Design/methodology/approach: Through both offline and online survey methods, a total of 304 Korean employees of eight airline firms in Asia were asked to complete the questionnaire. A structural equation modeling analysis was conducted to test the proposed hypotheses. Findings: COP and AVO had significant positive effects on the subjective relational experience, and COM had a significant negative effect on the subjective relational experience. In the subsequent process, the subjective relational experience had a significant positive effect on the perceived insider status but not on organization-based self-esteem and employees‚Äô service innovation behavior. Finally, the perceived insider status and organization-based self-esteem had significant positive effects on employees‚Äô service innovation behavior. Social implications: The results have important practical implications for developing human resource management (HRM) practices in airline firms. More specifically, airline firms should provide management training courses that encourage team leaders to create environments in which employees can form an attitude of ‚Äúwe are in it together‚Äù, collect conflict issues from employees in a unanimous manner and then resolve them smoothly without further problems and avoid treating conflicts as win-lose contests. These guidelines may help employees unwind from conflict situations and maintain positive relationships with their colleagues. Originality/value: Previous studies have paid little attention to effects of conflict management styles on employees‚Äô service innovation behavior through positive psychological experiences based on a holistic model. The results offer new insights into the extended model and have valuable implications for HRM practices in the airline industry.",International Journal of Contemporary Hospitality Management,eng,BUS,LightOrange

They developed a framework that yields optimal tests, in the sense that they nearly attain some local Gaussian power envelop. The main ingredient in their setup is that the variance of the process generating the changes in the parameters must go to zero at a fast rate. They recommended the so-called qL̂L test, a partial sums type test based on the residuals obtained from the restricted model. We show that for breaks that are very small, its power is indeed higher than other tests, including the popular sup-Wald (SW) test. However, the differences are very minor. When the magnitude of change is moderate to large, the power of the test is very low in the context of a regression with lagged dependent variables or when a correction is applied to account for serial correlation in the errors. In many cases, the power goes to zero as the magnitude of change increases. The power of the SW test does not show this non-monotonicity and its power is far superior to the qL̂L test when the break is not very small. We claim that the optimality of the qL̂L test does not come from the properties of the test statistics but the criterion adopted, which is not useful to analyze structural change tests. Instead, we use fixed-break size asymptotic approximations to assess the relative efficiency or power of the two tests. When doing so, it is shown that the SW test indeed dominates the qL̂L test and, in many cases, the latter has zero relative asymptotic efficiency.",Econometric Reviews,eng,ECON,LightOrange

Theoretical arguments for business environment and performance go in both directions. That is, on the one hand business environment enhances SME‚Äôs performance; on the other hand it also impedes its operation. Using these arguments, we hypothesise that both favor treatment of local government for state-owned companies and bribery (or ""speed money"") are negatively related to SME‚Äôs performance. Promotion policies of local government for private firm and local labour force have positive effects on SME‚Äôs performance. We test these hypotheses in a survey data from 63 manufacturing and service SMEs locating in three provinces of the Mekong Delta within the period of 2011 and 2012. Using fixed effect and random effect models, the empirical results release that local government‚Äôs favour policies for private firms and labour force have positive effects on SMEs‚Äô performance. The results revealed that although bribery has positively related to SME‚Äôs performance, this relation becomes negatively when the level of bribe is high. A major implication is that the study provides better understanding for SMEs in addressing the local environment factors, which significantly affect SMEs‚Äô performance. The results of this study can also be used as reference for anyone who is interested in start their own business providing insights into decision-making in starting a business and also for any SMEs which are interested in continuing to sustain and grow. In addition, bribery enables SMEs to use government resources, avoid red tape, and thus foster revenues. High levels of ""speed money"" increasingly absorbs the returns on SME activities, and distort entrepreneurial spirit and behaviour because favourable relationships with public officials provide entrepreneurs legitimacy and thus decrease the risk for closure.",Asian Academy of Management Journal,eng,BUS,LightOrange

Through a focus on post-communist outcomes and their relation to prior outcomes and causal precursors, this article assesses what counts as a historical legacy and how legacies differ from non-legacies.",East European Politics and Societies,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Research participants stressed the imperative for Indigenous children to be connected to family, community and culture. However, survey responses indicated that in many cases, family and cultural connections were not being assisted by cultural support planning. Indigenous caseworkers described the complexities of facilitating family contact, highlighting good practice as well as dilemmas and shortcomings in culturally sensitive practice.

We develop a model based on the stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) framework and use it to investigate how website characteristics, which we describe as sociability and self reference, of social shopping environment influence consumers' cognitive and emotional trust in SSCs, as well as how trust in turn affects their purchase intention. The results of our survey of 405 members of Meilishuo, a Chinese SSC, indicate that sociability and self reference features significantly influence cognitive and emotional trust, and in turn the likelihood and magnitude of online purchase. Moreover, the emotional trust plays a greater role in influencing consumers' intention to purchase through the SSC than cognitive trust, and participant involvement moderates the relationship between trust and purchase intention. This work contributes to our understanding of the dynamics that govern consumer behaviour in SSCs and adds to the broader line of research on social commerce. It also provides insights into how young entrepreneurs can tap the economic values of social commerce. Copyright",International Journal of Technology Management,eng,BUS SOC,LightOrange

In light of the reforms undertaken for the sake of the Euro, the article revisits the concept authoritarian liberalism that was introduced in 1933 by the German public law scholar Hermann Heller. This notion seeks to capture the liaison between the 'strong state' and economic liberalism. The article suggests that this notion can be fruitfully used to designate the new governance of economic and monetary union. It argues, particularly, that it makes sense to speak of an authoritarian style of governance even if the latter does not wear vestiges of outright repression. Two different faces of authoritarian liberalism can be distinguished: one that looks more towards authoritarianism and another one that views authoritarian rule as a managerial strategy that is good for the economy. The article then speculates whether the EU has been, indeed, successful because it shifts between the two.

This contribution provides a system-level description and comparison of the German and Dutch higher education systems regarding these topics, and points to possible interactions and development concepts connecting differentiation, strategic profiling of universities and excellence. Though both higher education systems started from very different positions and with differing policies towards differentiation, the global trends and national aspirations for the systems, as well as individual universities in Germany and the Netherlands, are comparable. A look into the resulting ranking positions of German and Dutch universities generally shows a more successful development for the Dutch higher education institutions in the last few years - which could possibly indicate a crucial time lag in the effects of differentiation policies in higher education as the German excellence and differentiation efforts fundamentally took hold more than 10 years after the Dutch initiatives in this field. ¬© 2013 ¬© 2013 Taylor & Francis.",Comparative Education,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Brazil also increasingly trades its parts with China and East Asia, while Mexico is still focused on its trade with the United States.

This approach builds on a rational model of decision making and emphasizes moral awareness and moral judgment, encouraging students to describe moral dilemmas and assess the consequences of various responses. Unfortunately, moral awareness and moral judgment do not necessarily lead to moral action; organizational variables and social influences frequently trigger emotions such as fear, anxiety or desire, motivating employees to act in ways that they know are wrong. A review of ethics education articles and a sampling of business textbooks and learning objectives indicate that attention to the role of social influence in ethical decision making is limited in business classrooms. The contribution of this article is to heighten the awareness of this deficiency among business faculty and offer a set of instructional strategies that can be used to expand the current use of case studies across the business curriculum so that our students will recognize and respond ethically to social influence tactics. © The Author(s) 2013.",Journal of Management Education,eng,BUS SOC,LightOrange

While Catholic climate change skeptics echo other skeptics, they also bring Catholic perspectives, often mingled with conservative religious and political views. Some express concern common among other Christian skeptics that believing in climate change leads to neopaganism and promotes anti-human sentiments. The focus is on Catholic climate change skeptics and their ideas, not Catholicism per se, and various cultural, social, and psychological factors, including their understanding of Catholicism, that impact their climate change skepticism.

All rights reserved.The study analyses expenditures of all municipalities of the Czech Republic over the period 2003-2013. It aims to examine whether changes in municipal spending get affected by the electoral cycle. The analysis has proven that expenditures of municipalities of the Czech Republic are influenced by the political cycle. However, the political business cycle has at the level of municipalities (compared to the macroeconomic level) its peculiarities. These arise mainly from limited options of municipal politicians to use economic instruments to win electoral votes in elections. To receive electoral votes, municipal politicians use mainly public investments and projects that are at the level of municipalities so apparent that they may influence voters in their electoral decision-making. Prior to elections, expenditures on investments significantly increase for all municipal size groups. For municipal size groups of over 50,000 residents, however, they are (per capita) higher compared to smaller municipal size groups. This may be explained by the fact that these municipalities have higher disposable resources (higher per capita own budgetary revenues, higher potential to acquire resources to co-finance municipal projects and broader portfolio of debt financing). Expenditures on transfers do not significantly change prior to municipal elections. We interpret this finding in a way that politicians prefer such investment projects that are ‚Äúvisible‚Äù. Transfers are used to pay for certain current expenses for which municipalities may (in accordance with the established rules) apply through grants.",Prague Economic Papers,eng,ECON,LightOrange

In this article I assert that after the critique of rights one way human rights may be productively re-engaged in radical politics is by drawing from the radical democratic tradition. Radical democratic thought provides plausible resources to rework the shortcomings of liberal human rights, and allows human rights to be brought within the purview of a wider political project adopting a critical approach to current relations of power. Building upon previous re-engagements with rights using radical democratic thought, I return to the work of Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe to explore how human rights may be thought as an antagonistic hegemonic activity within a critical relation to power, a concept which is fundamentally futural, and may emerge as one site for work towards radical and plural democracy. I also assert, via Judith Butler’s model of cultural translation, that a radical democratic practice of human rights may be advanced which resonates with and builds upon already existing activism, thereby holding possibilities to persuade those who remain sceptical as to radical re-engagements with rights.",Law and Critique,eng,SOC,LightOrange

The messy reality of conflict means that perpetrators and victims do not always fall into two separate categories. In certain circumstances, perpetrators can be victimized and victims can be responsible for victimizing others - this article explores these complex victims. Looking in particular at the 1993 Shankill bombing in Northern Ireland, as well as at Colombia and Peru, such victims are often seen as 'guilty' or 'bad' victims undeserving of reparations. I argue that complex victims need to be included in reparation mechanisms to ensure accountability and to prevent their exclusion becoming a source of victimization and future violence. I consider the alternative avenues of human rights courts, development aid, services and community reparations to navigate complex identities of victim-perpetrators. I conclude that complex identities can be accommodated in transitional societies' reparation programmes through nuanced rules of eligibility and forms of reparations.",International Journal of Transitional Justice,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Methodology/approach: The research for this case study was gathered using unstructured interviews with Lote Ocho community members and human rights advocates as well as textual analysis of social media documents, press releases, and reports. Participant observation was conducted during a community forum. Human rights theory, post-conflict theory, disaster theory, and narrative economy frameworks informed the research. Findings: As international human rights organizations collaborate with Lote Ocho to address the community's displacement, intensive focus on a lawsuit between the community and a Canadian mining corporation HudBay Minerals, Inc., contributes to homogenization of the community, reinforcement of destructive power relationships, and lack of focus on long-term security. Practical implications: Analysis of the potential harms of singular focus on legal action in the examined collaborations identifies areas for improvement for future collaborations in both Lote Ocho and other displaced communities. Originality/value: Caal v. HudBay is the first case of its kind. Thus, the analysis presented here provides critical insight for international and community actors regarding the successes and shortcomings of collaboration in cases of development-forced displacement, identifying areas for improvement for future collaborations with displaced communities.",Current Perspectives in Social Theory,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Co-production (simultaneous production of multiple outputs) occurs in some emission-intensive basic material and agricultural industries. This paper is motivated by ones in which a supplier sells its primary product to a buyer that incurs an emissions cost (voluntarily, or due to government-imposed climate policy) and sells co-products into markets without emissions costs. Emission-accounting standards provide three candidate rules for allocating the supplier's emissions among its products. This paper shows that under the value-based allocation, imposing an emissions tax on the primary product can increase emissions, by motivating the supplier to lower the price and sell a larger quantity. In contrast, with the socially optimal choice of allocation rule characterized in this paper, imposing the emissions tax on the primary product can greatly reduce emissions and increase welfare. In the absence of climate policy, under value-based allocation, a buyer might achieve greater profit by paying to offset its supply chain emissions. That can motivate supplier innovation to reduce its production cost. In numerical examples, considering the rare earth cerium oxide (co-produced with iron) and palm oil (co-produced with palm meal), the choice of allocation rule has a large impact on emissions, a buyer's profit, and social welfare.",Manufacturing and Service Operations Management,eng,BUS,LightOrange

ASMR - which stands for Autonomous Sensory Meridian Response - is a term coined by the community of Internet users who experience a particular tingling sensation in response to certain auditory, visual, or haptic stimuli. The sensation often originates in the scalp and travels down the spine and is reported to be immensely pleasurable, as well as relaxing. ""ASMRtists"" now flood YouTube with a steady stream of high definition videos designed to trigger this sensation for viewer-listeners, often through role-play scenarios that incorporate genre-specific techniques to simulate a personalized, intimate, and sensual encounter with the ASMRtist. This essay draws on affect and performance studies to conduct an analysis of these YouTube videos - using specific examples from the ASMRtist Olivia Kissper as case studies - in order to explore how media infrastructures produce the incarnation of sexuality through the process of mediated intimacy. Ultimately, it works towards a radical redefinition of sexuality that is more centered on affect than on bodily gestures, and suggests that through this lens the consumption of ASMR videos can be seen as a sexual practice and the configuration of ASMRtist, viewer-listener, and digital technology can be seen as a sexual relation.",First Monday,eng,SOC,LightOrange

An institutional perspective shows that important elements of U.S. security assurances will continue to function, and this reduces the chances that President Trump’s actions or statements will trigger proliferation by U.S. allies.

Following a review of the literature, a Poisson regression is performed on the frequency of long-distance business trips. The most significant determinants are socio-occupational category, income, gender and the urban or rural nature and size in terms of the number of inhabitants of the area of location.

As the Fund begins to serve its function of transfer-ring economic resources from developed to developing countries to support mitigation and adaptation activities, it faces several obstacles. Since contributions to the Fund by states or private parties are voluntary, they are not necessarily based on the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change’s “common but differentiated responsibilities” principle. Its governing instrument also departs from UNFCCC principles. In addition, the Fund faces a significant ambition gap in pledges to fund its operations. By instantiating several informal means of applying climate justice norms to assessments of national contributions to climate finance, some of this resistance might be overcome, increasing support for the Fund and, with this, increasing prospects for reaching consensus on a new climate treaty architecture at COP 21.",International Spectator,eng,SOC,LightOrange

On the basis of longitudinal questionnaire data from 1,685 sixth-grade students, the authors studied parental help with homework because it is the most common and most controversial type of parental involvement. Distinguishing between the quantity and quality of parental homework involvement, the research shows that completely different conclusions about the effectiveness of parental homework involvement will be reached if its quantity is assessed instead of its quality: How often parents helped with homework was negatively associated with the development of achievement, whereas homework help that was perceived as supportive had positive predictive effects, and homework help perceived as intrusive had negative effects. Moreover, the results show that effect sizes would be overestimated if students' prior achievement and family background were not controlled. © 2015",Journal of Educational Research,eng,SOC,LightOrange

However, the literature presents seemingly conflicting evidence on the implications of governance for bank risk-taking. The purpose of this paper is to review prior work and propose directions for future research on the role of governance on bank stability. Research Findings/Insights: We highlight a number of key governance devices and how these shape bank risk-taking: the effectiveness of bank boards, the structure of CEO compensation, and the risk management systems and practices employed by banks. Theoretical/Academic Implications: Prior work primarily views bank governance as a mechanism to protect the interests of bank shareholders only. However, given that taxpayer-funded guarantees protect a substantial share of banks' liabilities and that banks are highly leveraged, shareholder-focused governance may well subordinate the interests of other stakeholders and exacerbate risk-taking concerns in the banking industry. Our review highlights the need for internal governance mechanisms to mitigate such behavior by reflecting the needs of shareholders, creditors, and the taxpayer. Practitioner/Policy Implications: Our review argues that the relationship between governance and risk is central from a financial stability perspective. Future research on issues highlighted in the review offer a footing for reforming bank governance to constrain potentially undesirable risk-taking by banks.",Corporate Governance (Oxford),eng,BUS,LightOrange

Accordingly, India adopted a dual-pronged strategy for SSI promotion characterised by institutions and policies. Institutional finance has been the major source of capital for SSI including start-ups and even entrepreneurship is promoted with the support of institutions and policies. Because of the institutional financial support, start-ups have grown steadily and consistently though at a moderate rate in Indian economy. Our analysis using vector auto-regression (VAR) models and Granger causality tests ascertained that net increase in institutional credit flow to SSI had a positive impact on the growth of start-ups. But growth of start-ups did not have an impact on either SSI employment growth or SSI production growth but start-up growth positively influenced SSI export growth. Given these findings, steps to increase the credit flow to SSI to Reserve Bank of India (India's central bank) prescribed level of 20% of SSI turnover would give a fillip to the emergence of start-ups and thereby to SSI export performance.

While past studies have mainly examined the personality correlates of conspiracy ideation, this study examines the conspiracy-effect; the extent to which exposure to an actual conspiracy theory influences pro-social and environmental decision-making. Participants (N=316) were randomly assigned to one of three conditions; (a) a brief conspiracy video about global warming, (b) an inspirational pro-climate video or (c) a control group. Results indicate that those participants who were exposed to the conspiracy video were significantly less likely to think that there is widespread scientific agreement on human-caused climate change, less likely to sign a petition to help reduce global warming and less likely to donate or volunteer for a charity in the next six months.

Lack of statistically significant effects of national identity is not consistent with the pre-existing findings from cross-national surveys.

Although we focus on ""bottom-up"" dynamics, we argue that framing occurs in a politicized social context and is inherently bidirectional, in line with structuration, because microlevel interactions instantiate macrostructures.

How will China influence world politics in the twenty-first century? Many people answer this question by looking to Chinese history, and particularly to traditional models of Chinese world order. This essay seeks to complicate this question by asking which history, and which tradition? While it is common to look at China’s pre-modern history as ‘tradition’, this essay argues that we also need to appreciate how ‘socialism’ is treated as a tradition alongside Chinese civilization. It does this by examining how China’s public intellectuals appeal to two seemingly odd sources: Mao Zedong’s 1956 speech ‘Strengthen Party Unity and Carry Forward Party Traditions’, and the ‘Great Harmony’ passage from the two millennia-old Book of Rites. It will argue that these two passages are employed as a way of salvaging socialism; the ideological transition thus is not from communism to nationalism, but to a curious combination of socialism and Chinese civilization. This new socialist/civilization dynamic integrates equality and hierarchy into a new form of statism, which is involved in a global competition of social models. Or to put it another way, what these two passages have in common is not necessarily a positive ideal, but a common enemy: liberalism, the West and the United States.",Journal of Contemporary China,eng,SOC,LightOrange

We advance a portfolio theory of nuclear force structure, positing that states seek a diverse set of capabilities for nuclear deterrence, but that they also face major resource and organizational constraints. A number of factors may help to explain the portfolio of nuclear forces that states ultimately field, including resource availability, experience as a nuclear power, bureaucratic politics, the conventional threat environment, the presence of nuclear rivals, and the maintenance of nuclear alliances. We test the influence of these factors on force structure using a new data set of nuclear weapon platforms fielded by nine nuclear nations between 1950 and 2000.

They have responded to these challenges by developing corporate social responsibility (CSR) practices. Drawing on new institutional and management standards literature, we develop and explain the concept of ""regulatory scripts"", defined as the practices shared by a group of organizations in an industry in response to international frameworks and standards, which we call 'institutional expectations'. We examine a data set of international CSR-leading MOG companies and a set of interviews with experts in these industries. Our study contributes to the existing body of literature in the field by mapping and identifying the main CSR institutional expectations in the MOG industries, identifying the regulatory scripts that appear in response to these institutional expectations across 20 firms in four areas and 29 sub-areas of CSR, and evaluating the managerial reach/scope and limits of these regulatory scripts.",Journal of Cleaner Production,eng,BUS,LightOrange

On the other hand, the bond returns observed at the time of issuance are expected returns. We combine the empirical CAPM with the Modigliani-Miller propositions adjusted for risky debts, and propose a corporate debt pricing model (CDPM) which is the flipside of the empirical CAPM. The model shows that the systematic risk of defaultable corporate debt can be measured by the covariance between the returns on debt and equity market index. Using individual firm data, we test three versions of CDPM. All validate the positive relationship between individual deltas and returns with full or partial samples. Since CDPM is directly derived from CAPM, the results prove that CAPM can be validated even with individual firm data if proper expected returns are used in the test.",Asia-Pacific Journal of Financial Studies,eng,ECON,LightOrange

This study investigated the impact of different coaching orientations – promotion and prevention – on subordinate performance, and examined the moderating effects of coachees' implicit person beliefs and LMX. Four results were found. First, a promotion coaching orientation was positively related to subordinate performance, and it had a more positive effect on subordinate performance than a prevention coaching orientation. Second, subordinates with incremental beliefs relative to subordinates with entity beliefs experienced a better regulatory fit and demonstrated better performance following promotion-oriented coaching. Third, the subordinates in higher quality LMX relationships had better performance following a promotion coaching orientation.

The results reveal that an aging population structure substantially decreases school revenues, unless elderly homeowners receive state-financed reductions in their local tax-prices. Sizable differences hold even when comparing school districts located near each other but on opposite sides of state borders. Given the imminent aging of the population structure in the United States and many other developed countries, governments' targeted tax reduction policies could have important effects on equilibrium school revenues.

The study was conducted at the Soekarno Hatta International Airport, Banten. The sampling was conducted by using a simple random sampling and cluster. The results showed that the fares are not the main attraction for passengers to choose the same airline; instead they prefer the quality of service. That is, fares have no effect on the repeat purchase, but the quality of service seems to have an effect on the repeat purchase of the flight.

I extend the analytical frame of markedness through an application of the notion of biopolitics to these instances of linguistically mediated spatiotemporality within a U.S.-Mexico transnational context in order to describe how embodied poetics figuratively construct a resilient sense of migrant personhood that undermines its marked status and literally performs resiliency into being.

In particular, the analysis reveals that the social meaning of inherited assets is a contingent, individual compromise between seeing inherited assets as unachieved wealth and seeing them as family means of support. Being the lifetime achievement of another person, inheritances are, on the one hand, morally dubious and thus difficult to appropriate. Yet in terms of family solidarity, inheritances are ""family money,"" which is used when need arises. Taken from this angle, inheriting is not the transfer of one individual's privately held property to another person, but rather the succession of the social status as support-giver along with the resources that belong to this status to the family's next generation. Heirs need to find a personal compromise between these poles, which always leaves room for interpretation. © GESIS.",Historical Social Research,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

Undergraduate women (N = 116) were randomly assigned to a condition in which they unscrambled sentences containing words associated with sexual objectification, non-self-objectifying physicality, or neutral content. Following a manipulation check of these primes, participants reported their body shame and intentions to have cosmetic surgery in the future. Results revealed that priming a state of self-objectification, compared to the two non-self-objectifying conditions, increased both body shame and intentions to have cosmetic surgery. In a mediational model, the link between self-objectification and intentions to have cosmetic surgery was partially mediated by body shame. Controlling for other key intrapersonal and social motives linked to interest in cosmetic surgery did not alter these patterns. These findings highlight the potential for the consumption of cosmetic surgery to stand as another harmful micro-level consequence of self-objectification that may be perpetuated via subtle exposure to sexually objectifying words, even in the absence of visual depictions or more explicit encounters of sexual objectification. © The Author(s) 2013.",Psychology of Women Quarterly,eng,AH PSY SOC,LightOrange

The Case of Irish Social Protection Reform,10.1111/spol.12068,Development,8,"This article analyses the evolution of the Irish economic crisis and its implications for social protection policy, specifically for working age adults, in the context of European integration and Ireland's status as a small state member of the EU. We look at how neither small state characteristics, nor the position of small states in the EU, both of which raise problematic issues in their own right, are alone responsible for Ireland's crisis situation. Such factors need to be understood in conjunction with national policy models and preferences which, in the Irish case, leant it something of an outlier status in the EU. Substantiating this argument and considering its implications for social protection reform, the article first examines the evolution of Ireland's liberal and increasingly financialized growth model in the context of greater European economic integration and how its risks intensified, but were also obscured, under Economic and Monetary Union (EMU). Second, against this backdrop and despite the growing EU role in social policy, it examines how national policy factors meant that focus on income transfers remained dominant in social protection developments during the growth period spanning the mid-1990s to 2008. Third, it analyses the unprecedented degree of social protection retrenchment and reform occurring since the crisis, highlighting the congruence between national efforts and the impact of conditionalities associated with financial assistance. The article concludes by considering the question of to what extent Ireland will remain an outlier post-crisis given the direction the EU has taken in dealing with the Eurozone crisis to date. © 2014 John Wiley & Sons Ltd.",Social Policy and Administration,eng,SOC,LightOrange

All rights reserved. On 22 May 2015, the Supreme Court of Appeal (SCA) handed down a judgment in the matter of Lodhi 5 Properties Investments CC v FirstRand Bank Limited [2015] 3 All SA 32 (SCA). This judgement considered whether the prohibition against the charging of interest on a loan in terms of Islamic law (Sharia law) may be a defence for a claim for mora interest in terms of a loan agreement. This note critically discusses the judgment in the light of the approach adopted by the SCA with regard to addressing a dispute arising from a contract that has Islamic law as a governing law. As this is the first case to come before the SCA in South Africa, this note critically analyses how the court discussed the principles of Islamic law as applicable to the dispute between the parties. In particular, it questions the court's assertion that a claim for mora interest has nothing to do with and is not affected by the Sharia law's prohibition against payment of interest on a loan debt. It also looks at the SCA's approach (as a common law court) with regard to the enforcement of the principles of Islamic banking law.

Building on political theories of corporate governance, I examine how conflicts of interest and alignment among investors, workers, and top managers affect the implementation of announced downsizing plans. Using a sample of 656 companies between 1984 and 2005, I demonstrate the contrasting influences of these three stakeholder groups on two different implementation outcomes—total and managerial downsizing. The influence of investors who pursue profit maximization facilitates both, whereas the influence of workers who seek job security impedes the former but facilitates the latter. The power of top managers who attempt to retain managerial autonomy impedes managerial downsizing, but governance mechanisms that align their interests with investor interests facilitate total downsizing. By teasing out the influences of competing interest groups, this article contributes to a political theory of organizational policy implementation. By unpacking the implementation of downsizing and its potentially unequal effects on different groups of workers, this article also contributes to the economic sociology of downsizing and the broader stratification literature on economic inequality and job insecurity.",American Sociological Review,eng,SOC,LightOrange

This article explores leadership of place in the context of three urban middle schools in Morocco. School reform means that principals are changing from agents of authority to leaders with school improvement responsibilities. This shift in mission can be stressful for principals who are called to lead, but are often constrained by bureaucratic and place based challenges. Grounded in Riley's framework for leadership of place, the article highlights some of the physical, socio-political, emotional and spiritual realities within which urban school principals operate. One conclusion of this study is that in the face of often overwhelming physical and socio-political realities; principals dig deeper into their emotional and spiritual reserves to improve their schools and their students' lives. Their comments further suggest that the sustainability of their reserves is strained by the lack of adequate resources, training and autonomy to take significant initiatives. Comparing these findings against the backdrop of Morocco' official commitment to ending social exclusion, there is little evidence that principals are integrated in a holistic approach against neighbourhood marginalization. Failing to empower principals to lead reinforces school isolation and misses the opportunity of leveraging principals' rootedness in the community to help end social exclusion.",International Journal of Leadership in Education,eng,AH BUS SOC,LightOrange

Northeast region is considered a new rubber growing area of Thailand, the world's largest rubber exporter. A village in Udornthani province was selected as a case study for a qualitative research conducted in 2012-2013. In order to get a full understanding of these changes, the research studied livelihood changes in the village over the last 62 years or since the village establishment. We have classified livelihood strategies into three periods, based on the dominant mode of production and livelihoods. The first period was the livelihoods before cash crops, in which people were involved in subsistence mode of production. The second period was marked by the introduction of cash crops and market economy into the village in the early 1960s. During this period, subsistence economy had been transformed into market oriented. Forest lands were changed into cash crop farms, so much that the natural capital lost its balance and became less dependable. The third period, starting in 2001, was the rubber period, the focus of this research. Rubber came to the northeastern region as a result of the promotion of the state. Strong research, development and extension supports that used to work well in the Southern region were applied to promote rubber growing here. However, the adoption of rubber was not without problems. People had to adjust themselves to the capitalist standardized farming practices of rubber. In addition, there was a misbalance of and unequal access to capital assets, particularly financial capital. Within the changing socio-economic context and constraining status of capital assets and access, rural households adopted integrated livelihood strategies, including 1) economic diversification or pluri-activities to reduce risks and increase income 2) maintaining rice cultivation to guarantee food security 3) keeping the ownership of agricultural land as an important capital asset 4) investment in higher education of the younger generation of the household. The article also discusses the implication of these livelihood strategies on rural society, and provides policy and research recommendation.",Asian Social Science,eng,AH ECON SOC,LightOrange

Health care is a tremendously expensive service that deeply impacts the daily life of individuals. It has become crucial to understand all the factors that influence the usage of these services. Word-of-mouth (WOM) is such a factor, because it strongly affects the health behavior. A research gap exists when it comes to the analysis of the current state of WOM research in the health care sector. Based on a comprehensive literature review of the leading scientific journals in the health care sector, this paper investigates existing WOM studies. The investigated studies emphasize hospital recommendations as well as the necessary preconditions for WOM. The studies highlight that there are factors which are favorable to WOM and might be influenced by service providers and payers. Fewer studies concerned the spread and impact dimension. In this regard it is somewhat unexpected that three times more studies focus on the preconditions for WOM than the actual impact of WOM. Only a small number of electronic WOM studies could be found. Stakeholder theory suggests emphasizing factors which benefit WOM. As WOM might spread in networks and influence large groups of people, stakeholder theory further proposes considering WOM as a possible way to distribute specific health care recommendations. Even if the studies highlight the importance of WOM, several research gaps still exist. For example, due to the strong focus on hospitals, recent research seems to neglect WOM concerning health care providers such as a general practitioners or nursing homes.",International Review on Public and Nonprofit Marketing,eng,BUS ECON,LightOrange

FMM examines the possibility a sample is a mixture of ""classes,"" each with unique factor structures. To demonstrate, varying factor structures of father involvement are identified using father, mother, and child reports as observed indicators. Three classes were identified and relate to varying degrees of shared reality regarding the father. Predictors and outcomes of these classes are modeled. The class in which the child's view most overlapped with his or her parents' view was predicted by higher child agreeableness and higher levels of maternal depressive symptoms.

We conceptualize control at three levels: (1) perceptions of individual locus of control (i.e., feeling that one can control one's own circumstances), (2) perceptions of societal control (i.e., feeling that one's country has control over immigration), and (3) perceptions of an outgroup's locus of control (i.e., feeling that an outgroup's social circumstances are attributable to dispositional rather than external factors). Results show that all three measures of control are important predictors of negative attitudes toward immigrants: Those who feel in control (personally or as a society) are less hostile towards immigrants, while those who attribute negative outcomes to immigrants' predispositions are also more hostile.

The aim of this essay is to offer a better understanding of this problem. Firstly, it is argued that the problem of ""dirty hands"" can play neither within rule-utilitarianism nor within absolutism. Still, however, the problem of ""dirty hands"" represents an acute, seemingly irresolvable, conflict within morality, with the moral agent understood, following Nagel, as necessarily holding mixed, absolutist-consequentialist moral intuitions, pulling in opposite directions. Secondly, a distinction is drawn between real situations of ""dirty hands,"" and other conflictual scenarios, which are commonly, but unjustifiably placed under the metaphorical title of ""dirty hands."" Finally, it is suggested - utilizing Nagel's own ideas, as developed in his later work, and Sen's notion of evaluator relativity-that the moral ""blind alley"" manifested in the problem of ""dirty hands"" may not be totally blind after all, at least from the situated agent's own internal point of view (as opposed to that of an external observer trying to put herself in the agent's position by way of moral simulation). Thus, contrary to Walzer's approach, it is possible for a person (politician) acting in a situation of ""dirty hands,"" not to believe herself to be guilty, but still be a moral person. © 2013 Springer Science+Business Media Dordrecht.",Ethical Theory and Moral Practice,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

Some have argued that democracies attract each other as alliance partners, and thereby generate international peace as a consequence of their domestic regime type, while others have argued that the causal relationship is reversed, and that international pacification creates the necessary space for international alliances and domestic democratization. To disentangle this difficult empirical relationship, this article presents an empirically grounded simulation model of the dynamic coevolution of interstate military alliances, international conflict, and domestic democratization, demonstrating a statistical approach which accounts both for the complex interdependencies generated by coevolving multiplex networks of interstate ties and for their reciprocal influence on the coevolution of domestic political regimes, over the period 1920–2000. The results show that international institutions and domestic institutions are mutually constituted, with both ‘selection’ effects and ‘influence’ effects operating simultaneously. In particular, the evidence indicates that states with similar regimes are more prone to ally with each other, mutually democratic dyads are less inclined to engage in militarized disputes, and states that form international alliances with democratic partners are more likely to develop domestic democratic institutions. Tests of out-of-sample predictive accuracy, across multidecade prediction windows, further demonstrate that the coevolutionary model consistently outperforms specifications that ignore coevolutionary effects, in predicting subsequent patterns of military alliances, military conflict, and domestic democratization.",Journal of Peace Research,eng,SOC,LightOrange

The literature has been unable to separate inaccuracy due to the nature of the voter (such as non-attitudes) from inaccuracy due to interfering events after casting the vote (such as a change in vote intention). This paper employs event history analysis to disentangle time-invariant and time-variant explanations of recall inaccuracy. Using Dutch panel data on 20,936 respondents in 42 waves between 2010 and 2012 (and additional data collected between 2006 and 2010), we explain the likelihood of misreporting the 2010 vote during the subsequent electoral cycle. The analyses show that although both explanations play a role, voters’ general level of volatility before casting the recalled vote matters less than changes in vote intention after the vote. We conclude that accurate recall is affected mainly by events rather than the nature of voters. Our findings imply that survey measures of voting behavior could be improved by offering cues on the elections of interest.","Journal of Elections, Public Opinion and Parties",eng,SOC,LightOrange

We argue that the College Fed Challenge incorporates many of the recommendations in Educating Economists: The Teagle Discussion on Re-Evaluating the Undergraduate Economics Major (2009). We present results from surveys of (a) students from schools that participated in regional competitions in 2010 and in 2011 and (b) graduates from the University of Delaware who participated in past years. A focus of the surveys was to determine whether participation improved the skills described by Hansen. The results reflect the impressive effect on student learning outcomes. We conclude that the visibility of the College Fed Challenge can be an important factor in determining its impact. If the competition were national in scope, if the judges were carefully selected so that success in the competition were more meaningful, and if the American Economic Association were to provide stronger support, then the competition could conceivably have a significant and positive impact on economics education in the United States.",Eastern Economic Journal,eng,ECON,LightOrange

Considering quite different socio-political and cultural situations in the mentioned environments, it is argued that the identity perceptions among the Baloches themselves and among the others towards the Baloches (Persian-speaking Shi'a population in Iranian province, as well as mostly Sunni diverse ethnic groups in the Pakistani province and in Afghanistan) are not fixed ideas bound by ethnicity and/or religion, but, rather, flexible constructs dependent particularly upon the peripeteia of the state policies. The multiple aspects of the Balochi identity could constantly be negotiated, as well as manipulated by engaged parties. The main argument of this paper rests upon the speculation that the already existing and bona fide aspects of Balochi identity, such as ethnicity and religion, could be paralleled into the aggregate of ethno-religiousness depending on the socio-political and cultural landscape.",Iran and the Caucasus,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

After a general strike in 1910, the Siamese monarchy represented itself in urban space as the leaders of a sovereign nation with a racial Other in its midst. Rather than create a separate, walled enclave to contain this population, the monarchy drew on a material and rhetorical campaign to develop two interdependent cities with distinct racial identities. One city was a national capital under the authority of the absolute monarchy. The other was a thriving port city populated mostly by ""Chinese"" migrants and governed by extraterritorial law. Juxtaposing the built environment against its discursive representations, this article argues that the monarchy sought to endow the dual city of Bangkok and its inhabitants with racial characteristics to clarify national belonging, control the political power of the region's migrant population, and cultivate support for royal urban investments. © 2014 SAGE Publications.",Journal of Urban History,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

He argues that the quasi-market, predicated on the assumption of knavish behaviour (or agent self-interest), is the most effective way of directing school managers and teachers towards improving education outputs at lower unit cost. In this article, a review of the literature on the English post-incorporation further education quasi-market is undertaken (under the Conservative government [1993–1997], New Labour [1997–2010] and the Coalition government [2010–2014]) to assess if such a premise is correct. The conclusion from the review is that an over-focus on policy, premised on agent self-interest, effects limited improvements in the quality of education outputs and needs-based equity for disadvantaged students because such policy marginalises other motivational inputs, such as intrinsic motivation, professional values and tacit knowledge from the production process. The solution, much of the FE literature suggests, is the replacement of top-down policy with democratic local governance and participative leadership as a means of encouraging intrinsically motivated tutors and managers (or knights) to meet economic and social goals through the productive potential of learning cultures (or networks).",Research in Post-Compulsory Education,eng,SOC,LightOrange

How has the club of Western nations managed to prevail over its four decades of existence? This question is even more relevant in the light of the rise of the G20 at the beginning of the financial crisis in 2008. By making use of the concept of self-legitimation, this paper seeks to gain a better understanding of how both informal institutions ended up in a state of coexistence rather than with the replacement of the G8 by the G20. The main argument is that both needed (and still need) to carefully position themselves as distinct from each other in order to prevail and to inspire adherence. By including visual data and examining two informal institutions rather than formalized international organizations, the analysis complements concurrent research on the legitimation efforts of international institutions. The article traces three modes of public self-legitimation: legitimation policies, legitimation talk and nonverbal self-presentation. Based on textual analysis and a reconstruction of ideal-typical summit photographs (1975-2013), this contribution shows how both institutions present themselves as inclusive, accountable managers for the benefit of all.

Displaying that formalising informal sector enterprise is the most viable and most commonly adopted approach, it then reviews the two approaches of using either direct controls, which increase the costs of operating informally and/or the benefits of operating formally, or indirect controls that seek greater self-regulation.

Most studies in this research base typically included teachers and classrooms that differ, so the results represent average curriculum effects, which raises an important question: Are curricula that are effective on average also effective among different types of teachers and classrooms? We examined whether curriculum effects are moderated by three characteristics that influence curriculum implementation and therefore may influence effects: (a) teachers‚Äô knowledge, (b) teachers‚Äô attitude toward math instruction, and (c) the extent to which teachers need to differentiate instruction in their classrooms. We examined these moderators for four elementary math curricula that use different pedagogical approaches and specifically for first-and second-grade achievement.

By focusing on the removal of constraints, the LPS has successfully decreased the number of delayed activities. To further decrease delays, this research investigates the causes for delays at three construction cases. In total, 5424 scheduled activities were followed, whereof 1450 were delayed. The delayed activities were, besides the unidentified ones, categorized into 11 different categories and a statistical test of means was performed. The research revealed six often-occurring causes to delay: connecting work, change in work plans, workforce, external conditions, material and construction design. Furthermore, the study revealed five seldom-occurring causes to delay: space, equipment, rework, unexpected conditions, and safety. The findings have been structured in accordance to the preconditions used in the LPS theory.

We present a framework for hierarchical production planning which we use to identify good settings for three planning parameters, namely planned leadtimes, safety stock, and lotsizes. Within a discrete-event simulation which mimics the production system we use a mathematical optimization model for replicating the decision problem. This mathematical model is solved to optimality using a standard optimization engine. We use data referring to four different demand market situations in order to derive general statements concerning the quality and sensitivity of the three analyzed planning parameters. For exploring the parameter space we follow the concept of simulation-based optimization.

In this context, an experimental research was conducted, on a sample of secondary school students (N = 165) in order to examine whether methodical approach designed on the principles of problem-based learning based on differentiation of content gives better effects in learning compared to the traditional mode. The results of the final measurement shown that the experimental group achieved better overall success than control group. The results suggest that the proposed methodical approach contributes to better student performance in teaching geometry and that the most significant progress is achieved in the group of students who are average in terms of success and with ones below the average.","Eurasia Journal of Mathematics, Science and Technology Education",eng,SOC,LightOrange

Language added to the 212(h) waiver of inadmissibility has increased the number of LPRs that are now ineligible for relief from removal by barring certain LPRs from applying for a waiver if, since the date of their admission, they have committed an aggravated felony or have failed to accrue seven years of continuous presence. The controversy discussed in this Note stems from differing interpretations of this statutory provision. Nine courts of appeals have ruled that an aggravated felony or lack of continuous residence bars relief under section 212(h) only for those noncitizens who were admitted to the country as LPRs following inspection at a port of entry. In removal proceedings outside of those circuits, the Board of Immigration Appeals (BIA) holds that relief is unavailable to all LPRs convicted of an aggravated felony or who fail to meet the residence requirements after acquiring LPR status, regardless of the manner in which they acquired that status. The Eighth Circuit alone has followed that ruling (leaving only the First and Twelfth Circuits without an opinion on the issue). This Note describes the split over section 212(h) against the backdrop of current trends in immigration law around statutory interpretation and the agency deference doctrine. It analyzes the current state of U.S. Supreme Court deference to the BIA to understand how this issue might play out in the Court and argues that the plain meaning of the statute supports the holdings by the majority of courts of appeals.

With respect to the teaching of French, policy-makers have largely ignored the fact that most core French programs produce meager results for the vast majority of students. Only a small proportion of students (<10%) attend more effective alternatives (e.g., French immersion and Intensive French programs). With respect to immigrant-background students, a large majority of teachers and administrators have not had opportunities to access the knowledge base regarding effective instruction for these students nor have they had opportunities for pre-service or in-service professional development regarding effective instructional practices. Educational policies in most jurisdictions have also treated the linguistic resources that children bring to school with, at best, benign neglect. In some cases (e.g., Ontario) school systems have been explicitly prohibited from instituting enrichment bilingual programs that would promote students' bilingualism and biliteracy. Finally, with respect to Deaf students, policy-makers have ignored overwhelming research on the positive relationship between academic success and the development of proficiency in natural sign languages, preferring instead to leave uncorrected the proposition that acquisition of languages such as American Sign Language by young children (with or without cochlear implants) will impede children's language and academic development.

In the long history of the enduring connection between Italian cinema and national television, recent years have brought several new developments. Due to the economic crisis, and hence a quest for creative and production methods to achieve greater return at lower cost, the 'border' between film and TV has become the arena for several textual and productive experiments, with varying degrees of success, contributing to the foundations of a new model. On the one hand, television is 'serializing' stories that were successes at the cinema presenting them as sequels or reinterpreting the original story in a different way. This trend is exemplified by several premium fictions associated with pay operator Sky Italia, as Romanzo criminale and Gomorra/Gomorrah, or the Netflix project Suburra. On the other hand, forms of actual 'joint production' for both film and TV are starting to emerge, representing not merely a desire to spread content over several TV slots, but also the wish (and need) to envisage a dual outlet for a text right from the time of writing and production. Two separate objects are planned and prepared from the outset, as in the case of Tutta colpa di Freud or Chiamatemi Francesco/Call Me Francesco, forcing the writing and production routines to adapt and take due account of the specific traits of the two media, and of their target audiences. Through interviews with professionals, viewing figures and promotional materials, it is possible to identify the motives behind these projects, the modifications in their production routines, and how concepts like taste, success and quality are being reformulated in such a scenario.",Comunicazioni Sociali,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

Abstract: This article examines the distribution of students from various socioeconomic backgrounds across secondary schools in Hong Kong. Using data from the Program for International Student Assessment over the past decade, we computed axionomical indices of social segregation for 15-year-old students. The degree of social segregation in Hong Kong is compared with three other Chinese societies: Macau, Taiwan, and Shanghai. We found that social segregation steadily increased during 2000‚Äì2012. Hong Kong has the highest level of social segregation in schools among the four regions. The degree of segregation remains relatively stable among the top and bottom student socioeconomic status (SES) groups while substantially spread out among middle SES groups. Two factors were found to drive social segregation: gentrification of elite private schools, and the creation of semi-private schools for the upper middle class. Our findings suggest increasingly dividing education experiences among Hong Kong‚Äôs youth.",Chinese Sociological Review,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Theories related to the sociology of emotions informed our analyses from data sources such as preservice teachers' perceptions of the EC of their class, emotional facial expressions, classroom conversations, and cogenerative dialogue. The major outcome from our analyses was that even though preservice teachers reported high positive EC during the professor's science demonstrations, they also valued the professor's in the moment reflections on her teaching that were associated with low EC ratings.

All rights reserved.It has long been acknowledged that consumer confidence, risk consciousness and consumption behaviours alter in times of food crisis, often influenced by the significant media attention given to such issues. What is less apparent, however, is how consumers conceptualise, respond to and mitigate food risk in everyday, non-crisis scenarios. Drawing on empirical research conducted with consumers across the Republic of Ireland, this paper addresses this gap by examining how consumers assess and perceive food risk outside of the specific conditions created by major food scares such as BSE. Unpacking results from eight consumer focus groups, several themes are explored in this regard relating to everyday consumer perceptions, awareness, experiences, expectations and connectivity with food risk. Providing conceptual and empirical insights, this includes exploration of themes concerning: (1) food risk consciousness and the presence of a variegated food risk society; (2) perceptions of risk coming from the ‘outside’ into Ireland and related spatiality of trust; and (3) differences between consumer food risk beliefs and practices. Unpacking the conundrum of low consumer awareness of risk in the face of increasingly risky and complex contemporary food chains, this paper is relevant to food practitioners, policymakers and scholars alike. It demonstrates the value of including consumer opinion in food risk regulatory agendas to increase transparency, accountability and trust in food governance systems. The need for increased consumer reflection on food risk is also proffered, linking this with broader requirements to challenge prevailing risky food provisioning systems.",Irish Geography,eng,SOC,LightOrange

We argue that hedging behavior should not include costless activities that do not require states to face trade-offs in their security choices. We redefine hedging as signaling that generates ambiguity over the extent of a secondary state‚Äôs shared security interests with great powers. This definition returns the focus to security relationships and better accounts for the trade-offbetween autonomy and alignment. Based on this definition, we argue that hedging occurs in far narrower (but arguably more interesting) circumstances than is widely believed. Many Asian states have existing treaty alliances with the United States or major territorial conflicts with China, creating path dependencies that reinforce balancing behavior rather than hedging.

Care work, once a sanctioned labor of love, is increasingly commodified in transnational contexts. The picture of migrant women shouldering the housework and child care of local professonal women may seem like a mutually beneficial arrangement-matching the ""needs"" of the haves and have-nots-, but the global care chain ultimately works to maintain the traditional gendered division of labor as well as global inequality. To this trend of globalization of care work, Japan has been an exception; however, how much longer it will be so is now in a question, as the government paves the way for importing domestic labor from abroad. This article focuses on Japanese expat wives in Hong Kong in order to locate Japanese women vis-à-vis the global care chain. The narrative analysis on how they decide whether to hire a domestic worker in their home away from home highlights the sociopolitical nature of their supposedly private choices. Some drew on cultural ideal of wifehood and motherhood to rationalize their choice while others referred to racialized or even overtly racist and classist images of foreign domestic workers. A few women spoke against the system itself, showing awareness of its inherent social injustice. All such narratives are never purely personal; their decisions and the rationalization behind them sustain the prevailing discourses of gender, race, ethnicity, culture, and class, which, in turn, envelop their attempts at global householding.",International Journal of Japanese Sociology,eng,SOC,LightOrange

By comparing the rule-systems of both games, the article provides empirical evidence on how game rule-systems migrate between cultures and influence local game production by providing local game developers with pre-defined formulas for expressing their ideas while simultaneously limiting the scope of such expression with schematized patterns.

The results suggest that the financing rate has a negative impact on financing at Islamic banks, while bank-specific characteristics have a positive influence on it. The size and amount of capital have a greater impact than liquidity on financing at Islamic banks. However, changes in monetary policy are insignificant on bank financing, which implies that the transmission of monetary policy through the Islamic segment of the banking sector is weak. Furthermore, the weak impact of monetary policy on bank financing can be explained by the dramatic expansion of Islamic banks during the sample period, which contributed to a substantial increase in deposit growth and a high liquidity position.",Economic Notes,eng,ECON,LightOrange

The present manuscript provides an overview of the core findings of this research. The discussion of the variables determining assimilation versus contrast is embedded in the inclusion/exclusion model of social judgment (IEM), which holds that including accessible information into the representation of the judgmental target elicits assimilation effects while excluding it from the target representation causes contrast. Exclusion processes are triggered when individuals perceive accessible information as not relevant, or not representative, or when conversational rules suggest that using the accessible information is not adequate. It is proposed that much of the available evidence on the determinants of assimilation versus contrast effects can be organized into this general framework.",Current Opinion in Psychology,eng,PSY,LightOrange

Using both univariate and regression models with a sample of the 329 largest companies in the United Kingdom, we find a significant positive association between gender diversity (measured as the percentage of female directors on the board) and the propensity to disclose GHG information as well as the extensiveness of that disclosure. In addition, a board with more independent directors or environmental committee show a higher tendency to be ecologic transparent. However, if the committee is not sufficiently large, independent or active, its effect seems insignificant. The results are consistent with stakeholder theory, suggesting that a diversified and independent board and the existence of a board-level environmental committee may balance a firm's financial and non-financial goals with limited resources and moderate the possible conflicting expectations of stakeholders who have disparate interests. The findings should be useful for top managers and regulators who are interested in improving corporate governance practices and climate-change strategies.",British Accounting Review,eng,BUS,LightOrange

Recently however, episodic envy has been shown to emerge in two qualitatively different forms. Benign envy is related to the motivation to move upward, whereas malicious envy is related to pulling superior others down. In four studies (N = 1,094)—using the newly developed Benign and Malicious Envy Scale (BeMaS)—we show that dispositional envy is also characterized by two independent dimensions related to distinct motivational dynamics and behavioral consequences. Dispositional benign and malicious envy uniquely predict envious responding following upward social comparisons. Furthermore, they are differentially connected to hope for success and fear of failure. Corresponding to these links, dispositional benign envy predicted faster race performance of marathon runners mediated via higher goal setting. In contrast, dispositional malicious envy predicted race goal disengagement. The findings highlight that disentangling the two sides of envy opens up numerous research avenues.",Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin,eng,PSY,LightOrange

Both types of data have been used in impact evaluations of social programs. Objective: This study analyzes the causes of differences in impact estimates when survey data and administrative data are used to evaluate earnings impacts in social experiments and discusses the differences observed in eight evaluations of social experiments that used both survey and administrative data. Results: There are important tradeoffs between the two data sources. Administrative data are less expensive but may not cover all income and may not cover the time period desired, while surveys can be designed to avoid these problems. We note that errors can be due to nonresponse or reporting, and errors can be balanced between the treatment and the control groups or unbalanced. We find that earnings are usually higher in survey data than in administrative data due to differences in coverage and likely overreporting of overtime hours and pay in survey data. Evaluations using survey data usually find greater impacts, sometimes much greater. Conclusions: The much lower cost of administrative data make their use attractive, but they are still subject to underreporting and other problems. We recommend further evaluations using both types of data with investigative audits to better understand the sources and magnitudes of errors in both survey and administrative data so that appropriate corrections to the data can be made",Evaluation Review,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

The suicide risk difference has mainly been explained by minority stress models (MSTM), but the application of established suicidological models and testing their interrelations with the MSTM has been lacking so far. Therefore, we have contrasted two established models explaining suicide risk, the Interpersonal Psychological Theory (IPT) (Joiner, 2005) and the Clinical Model (CM) (Mann et al., 1999), with the MSTM (Meyer, 2003) in a Bavarian online-sample of 255 adult sexual minority participants and 183 heterosexual participants. The results suggested that the CM and the IPT model can well explain suicide ideation among sexual minorities according to the factors depression, hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness, and failed belongingness. The CM and the IPT were intertwined with the MSTM via internalized homophobia, social support, and early age of coming out. Early coming out was associated with an increased suicide attempt risk, perhaps through violent experiences that enhanced the capability for suicide; however, coming out likely changed to a protective factor for suicide ideation by enhanced social support and reduced internalized homophobia. These results give more insight into the development of suicide risk among sexual minority individuals and may be helpful to tailor minority-specific suicide prevention strategies.",Archives of Sexual Behavior,eng,AH PSY,LightOrange

The robustness of the fit results is confirmed across two communication modalities: TV and internet. Specifically, more celebrities are not always better. Fit matters whether the product/brand endorsement is by two or four celebrities. Fit among multiple celebrities remains important for high involvement target audience, but the number of celebrities (consensus effect) is more important for the low involvement target audience. The results of this research suggest that both high and low involvement audience can be targeted at the same time depending on the level of fit and the number of celebrities used in a brand endorsement.",Journal of International Consumer Marketing,eng,BUS,LightOrange

By estimating a dynamic panel specification at country level, this paper analyses how agglomeration and inequality (both their levels and their evolution) influence long-run economic growth. In line with previous findings, our results suggest that while high-inequality levels are a limiting factor for long-run growth, agglomeration processes can be associated with economic growth, at least in countries at early stages of development. Moreover, we find that the growth-enhancing benefits from agglomeration processes depend not only on the country's level of development, but also on its initial income distribution (something, to the best of our knowledge, not considered before). In fact, probably suggesting a social dimension to congestion diseconomies, increasing agglomeration is associated with lower growth when income distribution is particularly unequal. © 2014 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg.",Annals of Regional Science,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Relevance Theory is a cognitive-pragmatic approach to communication proposed by Sperber and Wilson in the mid-1980s (Sperber and Wilson, 1986). According to such theoretical framework, the relation between a translation and its source text is considered to be based on interpretive resemblance, rather than on equivalence (see Gutt, 1998, 2000). The translator would try to seek optimal relevance, in such a way that s/he would use different strategies to try to recreate the cognitive effects intended by the source communicator with the lowest possible processing effort on the part of the target addressee. The analysis carried out in this study is based on one hundred and ninety titles of Spanish and Latin American film titles containing puns and their translations for the Anglo-Saxon or international market. The strategies used by the translators to render puns in the translated titles have been analysed. The selection of strategy is determined, among other factors, by the principle of relevance. In those cases in which there is a coincidence in the relation between the levels of signifier and signified across source and target language, translators normally opt to translate literally and reproduce a pun based on the same linguistic phenomenon as the source pun and semantically equivalent to it. In the rest of the cases, the translator will have to assess what is more relevant, either content or the effect produced by the pun. © 2014 Elsevier B.V.",Journal of Pragmatics,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì Problem-centered qualitative interviews in two different contexts (USA and Europe) build the methodological approach. In total, 22 interviewees were selected from various retail sectors and hierarchy levels with the focus on store management. Following content analysis procedures, data were coded according to contingency theoretical underpinnings. Findings ‚Äì Environment shapes corporate processes as well as retail management in multiple ways. By studying fast fashion industries, the authors found similarities in retail management in all researched settings. First, the authors present relevant operational performance metrics in the retailing context. Second, the authors see that store managers aim to optimize processes and generate efficient and effective practices to maximize store performance. Third, information and task overload are reasons for neglecting performance information. As a consequence, managers call for decision-facilitating tools, e.g. dashboards, to reduce information complexity. Originality/value ‚Äì Widely accepted in contingency literature, environmental aspects influence business activities and performance outcomes. However, evaluating research studies that deal with performance measurement in retailing contexts reveals contradicting results. With the focus on larger retail companies with multibranch and department structures in two different national contexts the authors can unravel different perspectives on environment in operational retail settings for the first time.",International Journal of Retail and Distribution Management,eng,BUS,LightOrange

It is commonly assumed that sex and violence sell. However, we predicted that sex and violence would have the opposite effect. We based our predictions on the evolution and emotional arousal theoretical framework, which states that people are evolutionarily predisposed to attend to emotionally arousing cues such as sex and violence. Thus, sexual and violent cues demand more cognitive resources than nonsexual and nonviolent cues. Using this framework, we meta-analyzed the effects of sexual media, violent media, sexual ads, and violent ads on the advertising outcomes of brand memory, brand attitudes, and buying intentions. The meta-analysis included 53 experiments involving 8,489 participants. Analyses found that brands advertised in violent media content were remembered less often, evaluated less favorably, and less likely to be purchased than brands advertised in nonviolent, nonsexual media. Brands advertised using sexual ads were evaluated less favorably than brands advertised using nonviolent, nonsexual ads. There were no significant effects of sexual media on memory or buying intentions. There were no significant effects of sexual or violent ads on memory or buying intentions. As intensity of sexual ad content increased, memory, attitudes, and buying intentions decreased. When media content and ad content were congruent (e.g., violent ad in a violent program), memory improved and buying intentions increased. Violence and sex never helped and often hurt ad effectiveness. These results support the evolution and emotional arousal framework. Thus, advertisers should consider the effects of media content, ad content, content intensity, and congruity to design and place more effective ads.",Psychological Bulletin,eng,AH PSY,LightOrange

Based on generalized methods of moments regressions on a sample of 267 companies listed on Bursa Malaysia during 2010-2013, it is found that the board size and executive ratio have a positive impact on the firm profitability, although the coefficient value of the executive ratio considerably is greater than the coefficient of the board size.

This analysis covers 787 articles published in 53 journals over the timespan 1973 to 2013. We examine several important questions about the state of the art of academic research on NFI: How is NFI defined in the literature? Can NFI be precisely defined? How has interest in NFI evolved over time in the academic literature? What are the main topics covered by NFI research? What are the main methodologies used by researchers? To what extent are studies country-specific? We find that many articles do not define the concept of NFI but refer to underlying concepts such as social, environmental, human capital or corporate social responsibility (CSR) reporting. We document that academic research on NFI reached a certain degree of maturity around the late 1990s/early 2000s, a time when several new specialized journals were created that now capture an important share of the market. We identify 10 topics covered by research on NFI and show that the most frequently-studied topic in NFI research is CSR reporting. We also discover that the volume of research concerning auditing of NFI is growing, whereas management accounting/control research on NFI is limited. We find that the growth in NFI research is fueled mainly by articles using archival data (quantitative or qualitative) and essay methodologies.

Based on this premise, they should hold different views from people who have not been directly affected by war about punishing perpetrators of violence, remembering human rights violations, seeking truth and receiving reparations. The resilience literature, on the contrary, has downplayed the role of traumatic experiences in shaping people's views and rather stressed their ability to cope with adversity. In this article, we ask whether there are any differences in attitudes toward transitional justice mechanisms between victims and nonvictims, using a representative sample of the Colombian population (n1/41,843, of whom 315 are conflict victims). We find almost no statistically significant differences. Psychological resilience among victims may account for this counterintuitive finding. However, we suggest that social desirability biases, a pervasive impact of the long conflict beyond the victim/nonvictim divide and social proximity between victims and perpetrators may also be relevant explanations. Our results are relevant for scholars and policy makers, as they question elements of common (yet untested) wisdom about the political and social impact of violence on individuals' attitudes and about the prospects of peaceful coexistence.",International Journal of Transitional Justice,eng,SOC,LightOrange

However, frequency-based prototyping tends to limit the range of disciplines and texts to be analyzed and also disregard the diversity in the writings of research papers. This study visualizes all move sequences in an effort to show both the prototypes and the diversity of research papers using a program called Graphviz (2011). The study uses the results of move analysis applied to 13 education research papers and 8 economics research papers. All papers are move-coded manually by the researchers in each discipline. Visualization of the moves enables researchers and teachers to see the pictures of entire research papers with moves that have been discarded in frequency-based analysis. Compared with the traditional descriptions of moves, the visualization made it easier to understand the logical flow of the papers. Findings drawn from the visualization include interconnectivity across moves and sections and similarities and differences across and within disciplines that have not been shown in previous studies.

Professional socialization entails the transmission and reproduction of professional norms. However, within PWIs, professional socialization emanates from a legacy of race and gender exclusion. Thus, normative conceptualizations of professional development may not adequately address how Black women negotiate institutional cues to define their professorial role. The findings show that a three-prong model of engagement: enacting, discarding, and transforming institutional norms, comprised the participants' socialization process; agency played an important role in their career success.

Both texts represent a call for transgressions, since without these the experience of God is not possible. Eroticism as well as mysticism strives for the transcendental experience of union. This is however only to be attained in ecstasy, in a state of the Ego out of itself where the border separating one from the other is transgressed. This results in an unexpected and incomparable experience where no more boundaries between 'You and Me' are perceivable. Therefore eroticism is a sort of sacred reality that leads to the experience of the transcendent and divine and through it to the existential transubstantiation of the person. © The Author(s) 2014.",Feminist Theology,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

To discuss this issue I focus on the case of the creation of new forest legislation in Bolivia and the involvement and influence of actors such as indigenous forest community organisations and migrant peasant organisations in the process. How can subaltern actors be makers and shapers of environmental policies, and whose interests and demands are considered, included and excluded in these processes? The case study demonstrates that on the one hand, participation has been made possible and facilitated by subaltern strategies such as coalition building among different actors and strategic framings of their demands, combined with public and government agencies' responsiveness and the creation of 'collaborative spaces'. On the other hand, participation has been limited by fragmented processes for inputs, selective inclusions and exclusions of actors and underlying state-society tensions. Finally, the study illustrates how agricultural and land-use interests have influenced the law-making agenda and the development of recent policies affecting forest areas.",Journal of Rural Studies,eng,SOC,LightOrange

It explains the stylized facts emerging from this enquiry with an interpretation based on the industrial -change literature. Industrial turbulence, rather than labour market flexibility, is driving labour turnover within regions, as the correlation with the Lilien (positive) and the Herfindahl (negative) indices, respectively, shows. In other words, industrial change causes greater job destruction and flows into and out of unemployment, while, as also Alfred Marshall noted, the availability of more specialised districts could partly offset the diseconomies of specialisation in terms of greater exposure to external shocks, when the unit of analysis is sufficiently large, as it is in our case (NUTS1 and NUTS2). We also find that, at an individual level, the regional gap in turnover rates is due to regional differences in the gender, age and education attainment of the workforce, as well as the share of temporary work contracts and the size of firms.",AIEL Series in Labour Economics,eng,BUS ECON,LightOrange

All rights reserved. How can firms design collaboration structures for effective performance in R&D projects that involve multiple partners? To address this question, we examine the theoretical underpinnings of collaboration structures in multi-partner R&D projects - i.e., the scale and the scope of partnering efforts. Partnering scale captures the extent of resource interdependencies between a firm and its partners; partnering scope captures both the breadth and depth of the interdependencies between a firm and its partners. Using primary data from 147 multi-partner R&D projects, we develop and test hypotheses that examine the impact of partnering scale and scope decisions on partnering performance. Results indicate that partnering scale has a curvilinear relationship with partnering performance. That is, intermediate levels of partnering scale are associated with higher partnering performance, compared to low or high levels of partnering scale. However, we also find that the nature of this relationship is moderated by the sub-dimensions of partnering scope. Specifically, increase in partnering breadth appears to magnify the negative effect of partnering scale on performance. In contrast, increase in partnering depth appears to overcome this negative effect, allowing firms to operate at higher levels of partnering scale. Taken together, these results highlight the importance of adopting a comprehensive approach to designing collaboration structures for multi-partner R&D projects.",Journal of Operations Management,eng,BUS,LightOrange

A multiple-case online research was conducted and the results indicated that: (1) the 'free' education policies are neither 'all kids free' nor 'all fees free', thus could only partially solve the problem of affordability; (2) the policies did not solve the problems related to school place allocation, which in turn, tended to exacerbate the issue of accessibility and inequality in educational opportunities; (3) no monitoring and quality assurance mechanisms were launched to improve the accountability of kindergartens; and (4) the policies are unlikely to be sustainable as the ece budget entirely relies on the fiscal investment at the county level.

It further argues that a subsequent movement from consociational to centripetal power-sharing is vital to ensure sustainable peace. Design/methodology/approach ‚Äì A theoretical overview of power-sharing as a conflict-resolution tool provides the basis for this paper, supported by empirical evidence and qualitative research analysis for its proposed application in Syria. Perceived obstacles to a negotiated settlement are outlined, with suggestions made as to how these issues can be transformed into incentives for invested parties. Such obstacles include Bashar al-Assad remaining in power, and calls for the implementation of Shari‚Äôa law by some opposition groups. Findings ‚Äì While previously the conditions of the conflict were not conducive to peace talks, this paper finds that regional developments, including the rise of the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria, have re-opened the possibility of, and indeed the necessity for, political negotiations. Detailing the complexity of a conflict that goes far beyond a mere sectarian divide, the findings of this paper dispel the notion that a sectarian partition is a viable model for Syria. The paper highlights the multiple cleavages occurring simultaneously, and shows how a power-sharing model is best suited to deal with them. Originality/value ‚Äì The paper analyses the ongoing inertia of political negotiations to peacefully resolve the conflict.

It does so by examining the characters of Friday and Susan Barton in J. M. Coetzee's 1986 novel Foe. It is argued that colonialist ideology functions in the same way patriarchal ideology does with regard to the oppression of the racial other and women, respectively. Just as Friday is silenced on racial grounds, as an African slave with no access to power, Susan Barton is silenced as a woman pushed outside the canon of male authorship. Coetzee's novel draws our attention to the dangers of appropriation inherent to any oppressive ideology. Importantly, the novel tackles the discursive resistance to colonialist and patriarchal ideologies via the resistant body of the mute Friday (a body that resists reduction to colonial language) and Susan Barton's adamant attempts to get her story of island adventures told. By intertwining postcolonialism and feminism, Coetzee's achievement, thus, is twofold: A critique of Western totalizing narratives and a doubling of the political and ideological thrust of his novel.",Journal of Language and Literature,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

The analysis is based on the year 10 (age, 15 years) responses of 5,034 students from 137 England schools as learners of physics during the academic year 2008-2009. Factor analyses uncovered a range of physics-specific constructs, 7 of which were statistically significantly associated with intention to study physics post-16 in our final multi-level model; in descending order of effect size, these are extrinsic material gain motivation, intrinsic value of physics, home support for achievement in physics, emotional response to physics lessons, perceptions of physics lessons, physics self-concept and advice-pressure to study physics. A further analysis using individual items from the survey rather than constructs (aggregates of items) supported the finding that extrinsic motivation in physics was the most important factor associated with intended participation. In addition, this item-level analysis indicated that, within the advice-pressure to study physics construct, the encouragement individual students receive from their teachers is the key factor that encourages them to intend to continue with physics post-16. ¬© 2013 National Science Council, Taiwan.",International Journal of Science and Mathematics Education,eng,SOC,LightOrange

The weaknesses of politicization are even more devastating in smaller states such as Slovenia, as they have a limited amount of human resources available. Based on a detailed analysis of the politicization of civil service in Slovenia, the authors can confirm that the level of politicization is quite high. After accession into the European Union (2004) and the adoption of austerity laws (2010-2013), politicization increased even further. Despite the formal existence of a meritocratic civil service system, politicians have an increasingly decisive role in the employment and advancement of civil servants, and total control over the appointment and dismissal of senior civil servants.

Situated on Cambodia's border with Vietnam, Mondulkiri province has experienced a rapid increase in cassava production and trade since 2006, with transformative consequences for the region's forests and farmers. Using field data from 2012 to 2014, we explore how the boom ignited and intensified over time, through a conjuncture of conditions. Alongside strong market demand for cassava, these included resource abundance (soil fertility, timber, land, labour), connectivity to markets and cross border networks, and facilitative governance conditions. Over time, the boom strengthened capitalist relations, particularly through farmer debt and the revalorisation and accumulation of land. However, unlike booms of tree crops elsewhere, we argue that it is the very impermanence of cassava that is formative here, because the crop's short-term nature and low overheads facilitate practices like land laundering and land mortgaging. Like the ‚Äògateway drugs‚Äô that were believed to place users on a path to addiction and risk, this paper shows that gateway crops such as cassava may similarly place farmers on a trajectory of more intense competition and reduced choice in their engagements with capitalist modes of production.",Asia Pacific Viewpoint,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Second, empirical studies published between 1999 and July 2014 were critically analysed in order to generate an empirical research framework that embraces the following issues: geographical scope, level of analysis, tourism context, study methods and poverty measure. Moreover, an integrative discussion of the empirical evidence regarding the contribution of tourism to poverty reduction is included.

The purpose of this study was to conduct a feminist critical discourse analysis of a manual that an SDP organization uses for its HIV/AIDS prevention programme. The findings illustrate how gender was represented in static and heteronormative terms. Girls were constructed as deficient because of their minds and bodies, yet were also positioned as being responsible for preventing HIV/AIDS by becoming more self-interested and assertive.

Building the capacity of coastal communities to cope with and recover from a changing environment is a critical means to reducing their vulnerability. Yet, few studies have quantitatively examined adaptive capacity in such communities. Here, we build on an emerging body of research examining adaptive capacity in natural resource-dependent communities in two important ways. We examine how nine indicators of adaptive capacity vary: among segments of Kenyan fishing communities; and over time. Socially disaggregated analyses found that the young, those who had migrated, and those who do not participate in decision-making seemed least prepared for adapting to change in these resource-dependent communities. These results highlight the most vulnerable segments of society when it comes to preparing for and adapting to change in resource-dependent communities. Comparisons through time showed that aspects of adaptive capacity seemed to have increased between 2008 and 2012 owing to higher observed community infrastructure and perceived availability of credit.",Nature Climate Change,eng,SOC,LightOrange

For this purpose we analyse the Spanish network of interlocks, comparing the present structure (2012) with that of 1993 and 2006. We show how, although Spanish corporative structure continues to display characteristics of the continental economies, some major banks are significantly reducing industrial activity. Nevertheless, the financial organizations continue to maintain a close relationship with sectors such as construction and services. The analysis of the network of directorates shows a retreat in activity of industrial banking in Spain. Two large Spanish financial institutions, BSCH and La Caixa, continue to undertake activities of industrial banking in 2006, but this activity is significantly reduced in 2012. According to the theories on the role of the interlocking directorates, the companies in these sectors assure their access to banking credit by incorporating advisors from financial organizations to their board of directors. We cannot conclude that the structure of the Spanish corporate network has become a new case of Anglo-Saxon structure, but we got indications that are becoming less hierarchic as banks seem to slowly abandon centrality positions. This is especially salient if we compare the networks of 2006 and 2012, which show a continuing decrease of the role of banks and insurance companies in the network.",Cuadernos de Gestion,eng,BUS,LightOrange

The United States emerges as the frontier country because its best firms are far better than those of its close competitors. Part of the process of convergence to the frontier across the development process represents a trimming of the left tail, much is movement of the central mass and, for rich countries and many poor countries, it is actually the best firms that lag the frontier benchmark. Among potential explanatory variables that may drive convergence, ownership and human capital appear most important. These variables lose explanatory power as firm and average country management quality rises.

The social dimension of Bologna, in contrast, aimed to open higher education more across the social spectrum-though still assuming that the principal groups enrolling would be young. Bologna's social dimension was strongly influenced by EU debates and policy approaches: while it arguably owed its origins to this fact, the social dimension's limited success (and more recent displacement from policy, if not rhetoric) can be put down in large part to the difficulties in encapsulating complex and contested social priorities in internationally acceptable indicators, and to the EU's valorisation of competitiveness in the Lisbon Process (particularly after the onset of recession in 2008). ¬© 2014 The Author(s).

An NTU game is an NTU market game if there exists a market such that the set of utility allocations a coalition can achieve in the market coincides with the set of utility allocations the coalition can achieve in the game. In this paper, we introduce a new construction of a market based on a closed subset of the inner core which satisfies a strict positive separability. We show that the constructed market represents the NTU game and, further, has the given closed set as the set of payoff vectors of competitive equilibria. It turns out that this market is not uniquely determined, and thus, we obtain a class of markets.

This brilliant, and more compact and accessible, text was copied and copied again during the centuries and became popular in south India too, where a number of manuscripts in the principal southern scripts are still available. The success of a particular commentary is very often the indirect cause of the decline of the others, which are less and less read and, consequently, copied, until their complete or almost complete loss.

That cause, he argued, was consistent with geography, history and the need for coordinated responses to navigate a globalising world. It was also consistent with contemporary regional trends, as evidenced by the rise of cultural, intergovernmental and sporting connections. Though Hauofa did not specifically mention rugby, his work raises important implications for understanding the sport's growing regional possibilities. The following paper analyses the Pacific Islands Rugby Alliance (PIRA) in the context outlined by Hauofa. Founded in 2002, PIRA represented a coordinated response by the Fiji, Tonga and Samoa Rugby Unions to the rise of global professional rugby. PIRA's Pacific Islanders team undertook tours to the Southern and Northern Hemispheres in 2004, 2006 and 2008 before the organisation's demise in 2009. The article focuses on the following questions: How did PIRA emerge as a regional response to global professional rugby? What were PIRA's goals and what challenges did it confront? How did PIRA incorporate three nations into a new Pacific Islanders brand? To what extent did PIRA embody the kind of regionalism espoused by Hauofa? ¬© 2014 Taylor and Francis.",International Journal of the History of Sport,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

This paper analyzes both R&D in pollution control technology and pollution abatement by firms that are subject to environmental liability law (either strict liability or negligence) and are granted R&D subsidies. Firms differ in their R&D costs (private information) and experience technology spillovers. Policy makers may induce first-best abatement and R&D levels despite asymmetric information by graduating policy instruments to screen firms. The chances of implementing first-best activity levels by such means differ under strict liability and negligence, and examples suggest that negligence performs better. The paper also studies the case in which uniform policy levels are imposed on heterogeneous firms, showing that strict liability tends to outperform negligence from a social welfare perspective in this scenario.",Environmental Economics and Policy Studies,eng,ECON,LightOrange

Abstract: This case study research reports on elementary (grade 8) and secondary school (grade 9) teachers’ participation in job-embedded, professional learning and engagement in collaborative inquiry. Teachers constructed an inquiry-oriented media literacy unit following the collaborative inquiry model. The current study sought to investigate how collaborative inquiry influenced their self-efficacy in literacy instruction, instructional and assessment practices. Qualitative data sources included researchers’ anecdotal notes, teacher interviews, and professional learning blog conversations. Inductive analyses of the data generated six major themes comprising enhancements to teachers’ literacy instructional and assessment practices, which were evident in their adoption of the backward-design model, use of success criteria, and greater emphasis on diagnostic and formative assessment. With respect to teachers’ self-efficacy, data analyses also revealed increased levels of intrinsic motivation, professional satisfaction, and reflective practice. This study provides evidence for the transformative potential and characteristics of school-based teacher collaborative inquiry and the resultant impacts on teacher learning.",Teachers and Teaching: Theory and Practice,eng,AH SOC,LightOrange

We propose the use of a Kalman filter-based method that uses all available information throughout an electoral campaign to determine the systematic error in the estimates produced for each candidate by all polling firms.

In this district, two such teachers opposed standardization; nevertheless, even with resistance, they lost ideologicalbased curriculum choices. What are teachers of high-level students to do?

A fragmented research field and a diverse set of understandings (including misunderstandings) of the scope of strategy development at various levels of analysis make a thorough discussion among researchers and practitioners difficult. Here, the state of the art in the purchasing strategy literature has been structured as a hierarchical framework fostering a multi-stage understanding of strategy development in purchasing. Research suggests that in purchasing, it is difficult to develop a single, all-encompassing strategy. To the contrary, a hierarchy of stages emerges when general strategy is disaggregated into executable and controllable activities: (1) firm strategy; (2) purchasing strategy as a particular functional strategy; (3) category strategies for the multitude of supply markets; (4) effectuation by a set of tactical sourcing levers and (5) strategies for each supplier within a sourcing category.

A total of 134 BoP entrepreneurs, who run community information centres in remote areas of Bangladesh with the support of a leading private telecommunications company, participated in this research. The result revealed that support from a large private organization is important to ensure business success, and that this subsequently enhances the wellbeing of BoP entrepreneurs. Not only has this study empirically confirmed that assistance provided by large private organizations to BoP entrepreneurs influences business success, assistance also enhances the wellbeing of this vulnerable group and thus facilitate to reduce poverty within the local community.

Drawing on existing research on motivation in teacher education and educational psychology, the findings show that while some pre-service teachers developed their motivations towards teaching in the course, some others showed little change. The study suggests that pre-service teachers' previous experience and personal beliefs as well as the course content and design could play an important role in changing their motivations.

Data from two surveys of USA local governments (n = 861), modeled in a pair of negative binomial regressions, find a positive correlation between those cities with municipal power companies and those with an increased number of community-wide sustainable energy policies. Follow-up interviews with officials reveal the potential mechanisms driving sustainability by local governments that own power companies. These mechanisms are the increased capacity that publicly owned utilities provide by virtue of income generated and access to energy-specific grants as well as the local nature of their operations, which allows a better fit of sustainable energy measures to local circumstances.",Environment and Planning C: Government and Policy,eng,SOC,LightOrange

Background: Beliefs that it is unacceptable to experience or express negative emotions have been found to be associated with various clinical problems. It is unclear how such beliefs, which could be viewed as a form of unhelpful perfectionism about emotions, may contribute to symptomatology. Aims: This study investigated two hypotheses: a) greater endorsement of beliefs about the unacceptability of negative emotions will be associated with greater emotional avoidance and lower levels of support-seeking and self-compassion; b) these beliefs about emotions will be associated with higher levels of symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue and that this relationship will be mediated by social support-seeking, emotional avoidance and self-compassion. Method: Online questionnaires were completed by 451 community participants. Mediational analyses were undertaken to investigate emotional avoidance, social support-seeking and self-compassion as mediators of the relationship between beliefs about emotions and symptoms of depression, anxiety and fatigue. Results: Beliefs about the unacceptability of negative emotions were significantly associated with more emotional avoidance and less self-compassion and support-seeking. The relationships between beliefs about emotions and depression, anxiety and fatigue were significantly mediated by self-compassion and emotional avoidance but not social support-seeking. Conclusions: Future research should investigate whether interventions that pay particular attention to emotional avoidance and self-compassion, such as mindfulness-based therapy or modified forms of CBT, may be beneficial in reducing distress and fatigue associated with beliefs about the unacceptability of negative emotions.",Behavioural and Cognitive Psychotherapy,eng,PSY,LightOrange

The study extends prior literature by focusing in detail on occupational injury performance measures provided publicly by Australia's 50 largest listed firms. Content analysis of a sample of 239 annual reports issued between 1997 and 2009 revealed, as expected, firms in hazardous industries provided significantly higher rates of disclosure, in terms of both number of performance measures and frequency of reporting, than firms in less hazardous industries. Yet higher disclosure did not translate to adequate reporting on measures needed to demonstrate the prevention of serious injury. Instead, there was a strong reliance on variations of highly aggregated frequency rates often criticised in academic and practitioner safety literature. Further, evidence appeared to demonstrate strategic efforts to reduce the visibility of high-consequence safety system failures over time, thereby attenuating investor perceptions of occupational safety risk. The results provide important insights into the communication of corporate OHS performance to investors and suggest the presence of quantitative performance measures is not necessarily indicative of high quality disclosure. The findings also have important implications for the development of disclosure indices in future voluntary reporting research.",Safety Science,eng,SOC,LightOrange

This study examines the impact that export restrictions have had on price volatility. Food price volatility causes planning problems for policy makers and is disruptive to the food supply chain. An increasingly common response to stabilizing domestic prices is to implement export restrictions. However, if the country is a large enough exporter, the restriction can exacerbate global price volatility. Using price data on maize, wheat, rice and soy, we estimate the effect of export taxes and quantitative restrictions - as well as other macroeconomic variables - on price volatility. First, we use a univariate structural time series approach to remove regularities such as cycles and trends to yield an estimate of filtered price volatilities. Second, we regress the estimated volatilities from the first stage on a set of explanatory variables using a generalized method of moments (GMM) approach. The results from the GMM regression show that export restrictions implemented between 2006 and 2011 increased price volatility for wheat and rice but not maize and soybean. Simulation results show that the contribution of export restrictions to price volatility is the same order of magnitude as key macroeconomic variables.",Food Policy,eng,ECON SOC,LightOrange

An analysis of the espoused and enacted mathematics and English curricula for intermediate phase student teachers at five South African universities,NA,Education,0,"¬© UV/UFS. Regulatory bodies such as the Department of Higher Education and Training (DHET) provide a framework of formal criteria to be addressed by providers of initial teacher education (ITE) but these criteria can be interpreted in many different ways. The Initial Teacher Education Research Project (ITERP) has investigated the preparation of intermediate phase (grades 4 to 6) teachers of mathematics and English at five South African universities, selected as representative of the major 'types' of institutions offering ITE. In this article we draw on our analysis of data from this research to describe and discuss the courses in mathematics and English offered by each of the five universities to student teachers specialising in mathematics or English and to 'non-specialists'. We suggest that while there are examples of excellent curriculum design and implementation, none of the universities in the study is fully addressing the challenges of teaching and learning in diverse intermediate phase classrooms. While acknowledging that answering the question ""how much of what?"" is particularly complex in teacher education contexts in which some students enter university with an inadequate knowledge base from which to develop content and pedagogic knowledge in a number of disciplines and inter-disciplinary fields, we offer some curriculum suggestions for teacher educators to consider.",Perspectives in Education,eng,SOC,LightOrange

We first demonstrate that political group cohesion has always been high in the EP and one of the principal reasons for this is owing to the large number of lopsided votes that take place. We next demonstrate that on votes in which the main political groups are opposing, intra-party cohesion is lower than conventional wisdom would have us believe and, furthermore, cohesion on such votes has not systematically increased over time.",Journal of European Public Policy,eng,SOC,LightOrange
