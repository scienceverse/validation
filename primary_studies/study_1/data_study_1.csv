MAPS; Wieland et al., 2018) was used to determine whether the delay of
a study session qualifies as procrastination behavior.

Students’ task-related ambiguity perception for each (intended)
study session was assessed using four items selected from the German
version (Schmidt & Hollmann, 1998) of Breaugh and Colihan’s (1994)
job ambiguity scale. 

The German short form of the General Procrastination Scale (GPS:
Lay, 1986; GPS-K: Klingsieck & Fries, 2012) was used to assess students’
general procrastination tendency at baseline.

Borkenau & Ostendorf, 2008; Costa & McCrae, 1992) was assessed at
baseline (including all 60 items), using a seven-point rating scale (0 =

Visionary leadership was captured by the 5-item scale “articulating a vision” from Podsakoff

frequency of such leadership behavior.

Questionnaire
The questionnaires used in the usability study, the post usability
study, and the comparative evaluation are as follows. For each task
in the comparative evaluation, participants were asked to complete a
questionnaire using a 5-point Likert scale (1 for strongly disagree, and
5 for strongly agree).
Usability test - task 1.
1. Why did you prefer using the Settings options instead of the Chart
(node-link diagram)? OR vice versa.
2. How easy or difficult was it to use the tool?
Usability test - task 2.
1. Do you understand the split and merge functions and how they
work?
2. Probe: How was the experience of manipulating a color palette
using split and merge functions and was there anything unclear
about their functionality?
3. How easy or difficult was it to perform split and merge functions?
Usability test - task 3.
1. Do you understand the alter and revert functions and how they
work?
2. Probe: How was the experience of manipulating a color palette
using alter and revert functions and was there anything unclear
about their functionality? How easy or difficult was it to perform
alter and revert functions?
Usability test - task 4.
1. Does the History view help in your color palette generating
process?
2. Do you prefer to use History to return to the previous state in the
process of visualization interaction? Or you prefer to go back to
the previous state using a main view interaction?
Usability test - task 5.
1. What difference do you feel when using the Settings - number of
colors operation compared to manually generating palettes from
the visualization?
2. Which Layout do you prefer and why?
3. Visible depths: how many do you prefer (less or more number of
depths) and why?
Usability test - post.
1. How would you describe your overall experience with the tool?
2. What did you like the most about using this tool? What did you
like the least, or what caused your frustration?
3. What, if anything, surprised you about the experience?
4. If you could change one thing about the tool, what would it be?
Why?
Comparative evaluation - task 1.
1. Was the tool efficient enough to generate a five-colored palette
of your liking?
2. Were you satisfied with the end result?
3. Was there any discomfort/frustration when performing the task?
4. Does the tool allow you to choose your method of interaction?
5. Is the tool easy to learn and understand?
Comparative evaluation - task 2.
1. Was the tool efficient enough to match the palette as shown in
the given image?
2. Were you satisfied with the end result?
3. Was there any discomfort/frustration when performing the task?
4. Does the tool allow you to choose your method of interaction?
5. Is the tool easy to learn and understand?
Comparative evaluation - task 3.
1. Was the tool efficient enough to re-generate a five-colored
palette that you generated using the color picker?
2. Were you satisfied with the end result?
3. Was there any discomfort/frustration when performing the task?
4. Does the tool allow you to choose your method of interaction?
5. Is the tool easy to learn and understand?","""The questionnaires used in the usability study, the post usability study, and the comparative evaluation are as follows.

of its taste. This was measured by the item “For each of the
following foods and drinks, please rate how tasty it is.” Participants
rated the items on 9‐point Likert scales ranging from 1 (not at all
tasty) to 9 (very tasty). Participants answered this question for each
food product.
After the participants reported their evaluation of each product's
taste, they were asked to evaluate how desirable they found the
social image of the type of consumer they associated with the food or
drink. Specifically, they were instructed: “Please rate how desirable
the image of the sort of person who eats/drinks the product is for
you. In other words, please indicate your agreement with the following
statement: ‘I want to be seen as the type of person who eats/
drinks the product.’” Note that the questions referred to participants'

product. No visual images were displayed. Participants rated the

The questionnaire is a 36 item, 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 – (no, not much, or no, not at all) – 4 (yes, definitely, or yes, frequently) and an Item Reliability Analysis was performed for inter-item reliability (Onyx & Bullen, 2000). Furthermore, Cronbach’s Alpha (0.833) indicated a high level of internal consistency. We collected subscale scores for this questionnaire.

This questionnaire measures participant’s feelings about their current social support, including ability to Confide/Emotional Support (e. g., “How much in the last 12 months did this person give you information, suggestions, and guidance that you found helpful?”), whether the support is Practical (e.g., “How much in the last 12 months did you need practical help from this person with major things (e.g. look after you when ill, help with finances, children)”?), and Negative Aspects (e.g., “How much in the last 12 months did this person give you worries, problems and stress?”) of close relationships (Stansfeld & Marmot, 1992). The questionnaire requires participants to name up to four individuals who they felt most close to, and follow-up questions were answered based on these four individuals. In our study, we asked participants to name two close individuals in their lives. There were 15 items for the first closest person, and then 15 items for the second closest person. These questions were answered on a 4-point Likert scale ranging from 1 – not at all to 4 – a great deal. There were then nine more questions involving contact with family and friends, with answer choices changing depending on the question. Cronbach’s Alpha (0.797) indicated acceptable internal consistency. This questionnaire provides subscale scores for each of the three domains, as well as for each listed close person, and we combined the scores of each individual close person as suggested by Stansfeld and Marmot (1992).

This questionnaire measures social competence, and is also referred
to as the Social Style Questionnaire. The questionnaire measures five
domains of social competence, including Initiating Relationships (e.g.,
“How good is this person at asking someone new to do things together,
like go to a ball game or movie?”), Self-Disclosure (e.g., “How good is
this person at telling people private things about himself or herself?”),
Negative Assertion (e.g., “How good is this person at getting people to go
along with what he or she wants?”), Emotional Support (e.g., “How good
is this person at making someone feel better when they are unhappy or
sad?”), and Conflict Management (e.g., “How good is this person at
resolving disagreements in ways that make things better instead of
worse?”) (Buhrmester et al., 1988).

This questionnaire measures Bridging and Bonding Social Capital,
and it also takes into consideration the effect of the internet on our social
lives (Williams, 2006).

The SBSODS is a 15 item, 7-point Likert scale ranging from 1 –
strongly agree to 7 – strongly disagree, and participants self-reported on
their ability to orient and navigate in their spatial surroundings as
experienced in their daily life (Hegarty et al., 2002).

This task was designed by Arnold et al. (2013) to assess participants’
ability to form cognitive maps as tested in a virtual (video game-like)
environment that resembles a city (see Fig. 1).

This task was designed to assess the participants’ ability to form a
mental representation of the spatial relationships of five objects (geometric
shapes) located in a virtual environment (Burles, 2014);

Student-specific ratings of teaching effectiveness were assessed in the
spring of 1990 (i.e., Wave 4), using one student- and subject-specific
item: “How effective were you in teaching this child in math
[reading]?” on a 7-point scale ranging from 1 (Much less than with most
other children) to 7 (Much more than with most other children).

Students’ subject-specific interest was assessed with two items at
both measurement points (Waves 3 and 4): “I find working on math
[reading] assignments…” ranging from 1 (very boring) to 7 (very interesting)
and “How much do you like math [reading]?” ranging from 1 (a
little) to 7 (a lot).

Students rated the degree to which they perceived their teacher’s
subject-specific instruction as interest-supportive in the spring of 1990
(i.e., at Wave 4) by responding to the item “The teacher makes math
[reading/language arts] interesting in this class.” on a 7-point scale
ranging from 1 (almost never) to 7 (all of the time).

were determined using the Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale

severity during the prior week was assessed with the Beck Scale

Next, we measured financial optimism using four items (Tam & Dholakia, 2014): “I will probably have more money to spend in the future than I have now,” “In the future, my income flow will be a lot higher than it is now,” “I feel optimistic that I will be able to save more in the future in comparison to what I can save now,” and “I will be able to control my spending more in the future than I do now.” Participants answered on a 7-point scale (1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree; α = .87). Next, we measured the perceived importance of saving (“How important is it for you to save money?” 1 = not important at all, 7 = extremely important). Finally, we measured a series of additional variables that could be considered as possible alternative explanations for our effects. They included the perceived importance of indulging (“How important is it for you to indulge, to treat yourself?” 1 = not important at all, 7 = extremely important), the appeal of a western lifestyle (“To me, living in the West, and in particular in the United States, is appealing” and “I am glad [wish] I live in the West, and in particular in the United States” 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree; r = .78, p < .001), and the perception of a conflict with the values promoted in the posts (“The values conveyed by the Instagram posts conflict with my own” and “My values clash with what the Instagram posts are about” 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree; r = .83, p < .001).

We measured participants' perceived socioeconomic status
to control for the perceived availability of financial resources (Jong & Pieters, 2019) using
three items (“I have enough money to buy the things I want,” “I don't need to worry too
much about paying my bills,” and “I don't think I'll have to worry about money too much
in the future” 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree; α = .81). We measured participant's
perceived competence concerning money management (Khenfer et al., 2020) using two items (“I have confidence in my ability to manage my money effectively” and “I have excellent money management skills and ability” 1 = strongly disagree, 7 = strongly agree; r = .78, p < .001).",Example items include “The things I own say a lot about how well I'm doing in life”(see supporting information).,FALSE,UNCLEAR a third party source is identified without any indication of availability,NA,third party and within article,Supplementary materials hosted by the journal,FALSE,NA,"third party no, within article yes",YES,FALSE,NA,,Manual search was needed,Manual search was needed,NO there is no analysis script availability statement,NO there is no analysis script availability statement,NA,NA,TRUE,NO there is no analysis script availability statement,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,NA,,NA,NA,YES the statement discloses at least one source of funding,YES the statement discloses at least one source of funding,This research was funded by research support from Zayed University (grant number: R19062) and the ADEK Award for Research Excellence (grant number: AARE 2018-075).,This research was funded by research support from Zayed University (grant number: R19062)and the ADEK Award for Research Excellence (grant number: AARE 2018-075).,TRUE,YES the statement discloses at least one source of funding,Keyword search was sufficient,Keyword search was sufficient,YES the statement says that there were no conflicts of interest,YES the statement says that there were no conflicts of interest,The author declares no conflict of interest.,The author declares no conflict of interest.,TRUE,YES the statement says that there were no conflicts of interest,Keyword search was sufficient,Keyword search was sufficient

is a set of three measures used to self-assess independent living
skills and personal autonomy for young people in and leaving state
care (García-Alba et al., 2021). The young people versions of these
instruments (PLANEA-YP, PLANEA-9-YP, and PLANEA-T-YP) were
developed from the independent living skills training framework
proposed by Planea Program (Del Valle & García-Alba, 2021).

Staff Version. A staff version of the PLANEA Independent Life
Skills Assessment tools (PLANEA-S, PLANEA-9-S, and PLANEA-T-S)
was adapted for residential and care workers to assess the young
people’s independent living skills and personal autonomy.

All self-report items had to be rated on 6-point scales (1 = strongly disagree to 6 = strongly agree). Table 1 displays descriptive statistics, internal consistencies, and the correlations between study variables at each measurement point. 

Career involvement was measured with three items from Gould's (1979) questionnaire. The items were “I identify strongly with my chosen line of work”, “I get a sense of pride from my chosen line of work”, and “Sometimes I wish I had chosen a different career field” (recoded).

Goal conflicts were measured with three items from a scale developed by Höge et al. (2012). The items were: “Many of the things I would like to achieve in my life are incompatible with my career plans”, “To realize my future professional aims I must change my future aims in others areas of life”, and “My future professional aims conflict with my future private aims”.

Control variables. In all models, we included gender (1 = male, 2 = female) and age as control variables because in our sample, men and older individuals reported higher career involvement and lower goal conflicts. For gender this relationship was consistent across all measurement points (see Table 1).","Career involvement was measured with three items from Gould's
