43;2017;"Aloba, O.; Ojeleye, O.; Aloba, T.";The psychometric characteristics of the 4-item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) as a screening tool in a non-clinical sample of Nigerian university students;"Background Suicide is a major contribution to mortality among university students in developed countries. There is no reliable and validated self-report suicide assessment scale with adequate sensitivity and specificity for the identification of Nigerian university students who are at risk of future suicidal behaviors. Objective The objective of this study was to examine the psychometric characteristics of the 4 item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) as a screening tool for suicide risk assessment among university undergraduate students in South-western Nigeria. Method This is a cross-sectional descriptive study involving 536 undergraduate Nigerian students. The students completed the SBQ-R, in addition to a sociodemographic and academic related questionnaire, the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS), and the 12 item General Health Questionnaire (GHQ-12). Suicidal risk categories among the students were determined by interviewing them with the items of the suicidality module section of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview (MINI). Results Cronbach's alpha for the SBQ-R items was 0.80. Construct validity was supported through significant positive correlations with the HADS-Anxiety and Depression subscales, and the GHQ-12. Receiver Operating Characteristics (ROC) curve evaluation suggests that the best cut-off total score with the optimal sensitivity (0.882), specificity (0.875) and highest accuracy (0.879) was 8 in terms of identifying the students at high risk of suicide (Area Under the Curve = 0.928; 95% Confidence Interval = 0.890–0.966; Standard Error = 0.019). Conclusions The use of the SBQ-R may be an important and vital step in the prevention of suicidal attempts among Nigerian university students. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.";Asian Journal of Psychiatry;10.1016/j.ajp.2017.01.017;English;5;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

The study aimed at validating Suicide Behavior Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R) among Iranian undergraduates. Methods: A total of 487 undergraduates were surveyed in 2018. Construct validity of SBQ-R was examined via confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), and Spearman's correlation with two single-item indices of suicide acceptability (SA) and lifetime suicidal ideation (LSI) was determined. Logistic regression and Kruskal-Wallis tests were used to examine the cut-off points (? 7 and ? 8) and categorizations as per item 1. Results: The mean SBQ-R score was 5.79 ± 3.55. Cut-off points ? 7 and ? 8 categorized 150 (30.8%) and 123 (25.2%) samples with suicide risk, respectively. Women obtained significantly higher scores on all indices, except items 1 and 4. CFA confirmed the model with sound goodness-of-fit, with factor loadings of 0.70 to 0.83. Composite reliability and average variance extracted were 0.87 and 0.63, respectively. The SBQ-R's correlation with SA and LSI confirmed its concurrent validity. Regression analysis confirmed the ability of both cut-off points to distinguish the participants with high SA and LSI; however, the cut-off point ? 8 produced better results regarding high LSI. Based on item 1, normal versus low- and high-risk samples were significantly different in terms of SA, LSI, and adjusted total score of SBQ-R (P < 0.0001). Conclusion: SBQ-R is an economic and psychometrically sound tool, which can be utilized to identify suicide-related behaviors and risks in young Iranian population. © 2019 Elsevier B.V.";Asian Journal of Psychiatry;10.1016/j.ajp.2019.101856;English;4;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

153;2023;"Banos-Chaparro, Jonatan; Guillen, Fiorella Gaby Fuster";Psychometric evidence of the Roberts Suicidal Ideation Scale in Peruvian adolescents;"Suicidal ideation are thoughts related to death, with or without planning the place or the methods that would be used to kill oneself. Suicidal ideation has been shown to be more prevalent in adolescence, a crucial stage during human development. Identifying and intervening these problems is of utmost importance to prevent suicidal behaviors and the comorbidity of other psychological prob-lems that can worsen the mental and physical health of the adolescent. A complementary tool in clinical practice or basic research are psychometric instruments that allow evalu-ating non-observable constructs in the field of psychology, for example, suicidal ideation. Therefore, the objective of the study was to present the sources of validity evidence based on the content, internal structure and in the relationship with other variables of the Roberts Suicidal Ideation Scale in Peruvian adolescents.The study has an instrumental and cross-sec-tional design. 399 adolescents residing in Lima participated, selected through convenience sampling and inclusion criteria: a) be between 10 and 19 years old, b) place of residence in Lima and c) have accepted informed consent. Adolescents who did not meet these criteria were excluded from the study. All partici-pants answered three scales, which were: the Roberts Suicidal Ideation Scale, the Paykel Suicidal Ideation Scale and the Rosenberg Self-Esteem Scale. The last two scales have evidence of validity in the Peruvian adoles-cent population. In that sense, 237 (59.4 %) were women and 162 (40.6 %) were men. The mean age was 17.81 (SD = 1.03) in a range of 15 to 19 years. Likewise, additional questions were asked about suicidal behavior during the last 12 months, where 2.8 % considered seri-ously committing suicide, 2.5 % made suicide plans, and 2.5 % attempted suicide, but were unsuccessful.Regarding the results of the investiga-tion. In principle, three Peruvian psycholo-gists reviewed the content of the items and all considered that the items were represen-tative and relevant to explain the construct. Likewise, through the modeling of structural equations, a confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was applied to analyze the internal structure of the scale, where it was evidenced that the structure was essentially one-dimen-sional (CFI = .99; RMSEA = .04 [90 % CI; .00-.12], SRMR = .01, WRMR = .30) and presented factorial loads (lambda) higher than .50. On the other hand, the internal consistency was acceptable omega = .84 [95 % CI: .81-.86] and reliability of the construct H = .94, showing that the items are homogeneous and coherent. The multigroup measurement invariance and its different conditions (configural, metric and strong) according to sex (women vs. men) and age (15 to 17 years vs. 18 to 19 years), was stable in the different restrictions and fulfilling the points of Suggested. Cut-off for the vari-ation of the fit indices: (Delta CFI < .01; Delta SRMR < .03), showing that the internal structure of the instrument is the same for the sex and age groups. Finally, a positive relationship was found (r = .35; p = .01) with another instru-ment that assesses suicidal ideation (thoughts of death, suicidal ideation and suicide attempt) and negative relationships with the positive dimension (r =-.31; p = .01) and negative dimension (r =-.25; p = .01) of self-esteem. All correlations had a minimal effect size.The research results suggest a one-dimen-sional factorial structure, adequate internal and construct consistency, coherent rela-tionship with other variables and invariance according to sex and age. The findings allow us to conclude and recommend of the Roberts Suicidal Ideation Scale scores for the specific use in Peruvian adolescents and compar-ison of groups (sex and age) are reliable and adequate.";INTERDISCIPLINARIA;10.16888/interd.2023.40.1.10;Spanish;2;2;;0;0;;;;0;

Purpose: Our purpose was to compare findings from psychometric validation of the 20-item SRQ with a modified version, the SRQ-SIB (suicidal ideation and behavior). Methods: Factor analysis of both scales was performed in a sample of Congolese refugee women as well as predictive validity, contrast validity, and internal consistency. Results: Both scales exhibited a reliability of.911. The SRQ-SIB exhibited a three-factor solution; somatic, psychological, and SIB. The SIB was highly predictive for having experienced sexual violence. Analyses validate the use of both, but the SIB is useful for differentiating more severe cases of common mental disorder (CMD). Conclusions: The SRQ-SIB may be an important tool for the nursing assessment of suicide among refugee women. © 2015 Springer Publishing Company.";Journal of Nursing Measurement;10.1891/1061-3749.23.3.393;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Rates of NSSI appear to be disproportionately high in adolescents and young adults, and is a risk factor for suicidal ideation and behavior. The present study reports the psychometric properties of the Impulse, Self-harm and Suicide Ideation Questionnaire for Adolescents (ISSIQ-A), a measure designed to comprehensively assess the impulsivity, NSSI behaviors and suicide ideation. An additional module of this questionnaire assesses the functions of NSSI. Results of Confirmatory Factor Analysis (CFA) of the scale on 1722 youths showed items' suitability and confirmed a model of four different dimensions (Impulse, Self-harm, Risk-behavior and Suicide ideation) with good fit and validity. Further analysis showed that youth[U+05F3]s engagement in self-harm may exert two different functions: to create or alleviate emotional states, and to influence social relationships. Our findings contribute to research and assessment on non-suicidal self-injury, suggesting that the ISSIQ-A is a valid and reliable measure to assess impulse, self-harm and suicidal thoughts, in adolescence. © 2015 Elsevier Ireland Ltd.;Psychiatry Research;10.1016/j.psychres.2015.01.031;English;3;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Yet, there are no suicidality assessment tools developed or validated for these groups. Methods: A widely used and validated suicidality assessment tool developed for the general population (SBQ-R), was adapted using feedback from autistic adults, to create the Suicidal Behaviours Questionnaire—Autism Spectrum Conditions (SBQ-ASC). The adapted tool was refined through nine interviews, and an online survey with 251 autistic adults, to establish clarity and relevance of the items. Subsequently, 308 autistic, 113 possibly autistic, and 268 non-autistic adults completed the adapted tool online, alongside self-report measures of autistic traits (AQ), camouflaging autistic traits (CAT-Q), depression (PHQ-9), anxiety (ASA-A), thwarted belongingness and perceived burdensomeness (INQ-15), lifetime non-suicidal self-injury, and the original version of the suicidality assessment tool (SBQ-R). Analyses explored the appropriateness and measurement properties of the adapted tool between the groups. Results: There was evidence in support of content validity, structural validity, internal consistency, convergent and divergent validity, test–retest validity, sensitivity and specificity (for distinguishing those with or without lifetime experience of suicide attempt), and hypothesis testing of the adapted tool (SBQ-ASC) in each group. The structure of the SBQ-ASC was equivalent between autistic and possibly autistic adults, regardless of gender, or use of visual aids to help quantify abstract rating scales. Limitations: The samples involved in the development and validation of the adapted tool were largely female, and largely diagnosed as autistic in adulthood, which limits the generalisability of results to the wider autistic population. The SBQ-ASC has been developed for use in research and is not recommended to assess risk of future suicide attempts and/or self-harm. The SBQ-ASC has been designed with and for autistic and possibly autistic adults, and is not appropriate to compare to non-autistic adults given measurement differences between these groups. Conclusions: The SBQ-ASC is a brief self-report suicidality assessment tool, developed and validated with and for autistic adults, without co-occurring intellectual disability. The SBQ-ASC is appropriate for use in research to identify suicidal thoughts and behaviours in autistic and possibly autistic people, and model associations with risk and protective factors. © 2021, The Author(s).;Molecular Autism;10.1186/s13229-021-00449-3;English;3;2;;0;1;1;0;0;0;repositorio institucional

Reliability and validity were evaluated for the newly developed Suicide Screening Questionnaire-Observer Rating (SSQ-OR). Methods: Preliminary items were assessed by 251 experts online and 25 questions were selected. 328 individuals at high-risk and 661 controls from 12 Crisis Response Centers and 5 university counseling centers were recruited to complete SSQ-OR, Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI) and Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In a 6 months follow-up, we reached out to 176 participants to ask whether they had experienced a suicidal thought, plan, or attempt since the baseline assessment. Cronbach's ?, Mann-Whitney U test, Spearman's correlation, factor analyses, Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis and logistic regression analysis were used to verify the SSQ-OR. Results: Structural validity was supported by a two-factor solution using exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses. Excellent model fit indices for the two-factor structure using exploratory factor analysis were confirmed (RMSEA = 0.033, TLI = 0.980, CFI = 0.983). The SSQ-OR demonstrated strong internal consistency. The concurrent validity based on the correlations with other self-reported indicators of suicidal potential–BSSI and PHQ-9– revealed substantial relationships. The high-risk group was effectively characterized by a cut-off point of 4, with a sensitivity of 0.73 and a specificity of 0.79. The SSQ-OR scores were significant predictors of suicidal thoughts and behaviors within 6 months. Conclusions: The SSQ-OR exhibits sound psychometric properties, and could be used as a complement to a self-report or clinical-administered scale to screen suicide risk comprehensively.

41;2015;"Ellis, T.E.; Rufino, K.A.";A psychometric study of the suicide cognitions scale with psychiatric inpatients;"The cognitive model of suicide makes specific predictions about the role of cognition in suicide risk. This study examined psychometric properties of the Suicide Cognitions Scale (SCS), an instrument designed to measure suicide-specific cognitions, in a sample of 150 patients (age range, 18-75 years, SD = 14.42; 56% female, 94% White) hospitalized for suicide risk associated with multiple, treatment-resistant psychiatric conditions. Findings revealed strong psychometric properties, including internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Incremental validity beyond depression and hopelessness was demonstrated in the prediction of suicidal ideation. Confirmatory factor analysis examining previously reported factor solutions suggested more consistency with a three-factor solution (Unlovability, Unbearability, and Unsolvability) relative to a two-factor solution. Good sensitivity to treatment response over the course of hospitalization also was demonstrated. The hypothesis of residual risk, derived from cognitive theory and predicting that lack of change in suicide schemas would be associated with higher suicide risk at discharge, was supported. Overall, these findings suggest considerable promise for the SCS as a measure of suicide risk that adds predictive utility to measures of depression and hopelessness, with potential usefulness in planning and monitoring treatment for suicidal individuals. © 2014 American Psychological Association.";Psychological Assessment;10.1037/pas0000028;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

However, there is only limited information about the psychometric characteristics of BSSI in the Persian language. In this study, we investigated the validity, reliability and factor structure of the BSSI in the general population of Tehran. Methods: Initially, 900 questionnaire packages were distributed to the general population of Tehran (response rate: 59 percent), using cluster random sampling method. The questionnaire package consisted of a demographic questionnaire, the Persian translation of the BSSI, Symptom checklist-90- Revised (SCL-90-R), Beck Hopelessness Inventory (BHI) and Philips Social Support Appraisal Scale. Internal consistency and correlations of the BSSI scores with other constructs were investigated. Factor analysis was done using principal component method. Results: The Cronbach's alpha coefficients of the screening part and the whole scale were satisfactory (>0.8). The scores of both the screening part and the total scale in individuals who experienced suicidal attempt were higher than others. Both the screening part and the total scale had a positive correlation with depression and Global Severity Index in SCL-90-R, and a negative correlation with social support. The scores of the screening part had a positive correlation with anxiety, psychoticism, hostility and hopelessness as well. The screening part consisted of a single factor which explains 60% of the total variance. Conclusion: The Persian translation of the BSSI has desirable psychometric properties in research setting. However, the clinical usage of the scale remains to be explored, and the factor structure of the whole questionnaire should be assessed in a clinical sample.;Medical Journal of the Islamic Republic of Iran;;English;4;2;;0;0;;;;0;

Research found that screening for suicidal ideation in non-clinical populations such as schools or communities is an important step toward preventing suicide. Despite so, not all screening tools have the capabilities to accurately detect suicidal ideation among adolescents and young adults in non-clinical populations. The Suicidal Ideation Scale (SIS) is one of the most used questionnaires to measure suicidal thoughts in non-clinical populations. This study aims to investigate the psychometric properties of SIS among adolescents and young adults in Indonesia, especially in non-clinical populations. Methods: After a series of language and cultural adaptations, 1254 senior high school and university students completed the Indonesian version of SIS using 3 standard questionnaires, namely Patient Health Questionnaire-9/PHQ-9, Beck Depression Inventory-II/BDI-II, and Children’s Depression Inventory/CDI. The SIS content validity, internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent, as well as internal structure validity, were investigated using content validity index (CVI), Cronbach’s Alpha, Pearson product-moment correlation, and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA), respectively. Results: The result showed that SIS has good to excellent internal consistency and test-retest reliability. Based on the validity indicators, it has satisfactory content and convergent validity, and further support the one-factor and 2-factor model for factorial validity. Both one-factor and 2 factor model are suitable to use in non-clinical settings. Conclusions: SIS is a valid and reliable tool for suicide ideation screening in adolescents and young adults in non-clinical populations. This validated questionnaire can be used in the early detection of suicidal ideation among adolescents and young adults in non-clinical populations, thus contributing to developing strategies and policies to prevent suicide among Indonesian adolescents and young adults at group and institutional levels. © The Author(s) 2022.;Journal of Primary Care and Community Health;10.1177/21501319221143716;English;4;2;;0;0;;;;0;

Methods: As part of the EU project 'Suicidality: Treatment Occurring in Paediatrics' (STOP project), we developed web-based Patient Reported Outcome Measures (PROMs) for children and adolescents and for proxy reports by parents and clinicians in order to assess suicidality. Based on a literature review, expert panels and focus groups of patients, we developed the items of the STOP Suicidality Assessment Scale (STOP-SAS) in Spanish and English, translated it into four more languages, and optimized it for web-based presentation using the HealthTrackerTM platform. Of the total 19 questions developed for the STOP-SAS, four questions that assess low-level suicidality were identified as screening questions (three of them for use with children, and all four for use with adolescents, parents and clinicians). A total of 395 adolescents, 110 children, 637 parents and 716 clinicians completed the questionnaire using the HealthTrackerTM, allowing us to evaluate the internal consistency and convergent validity of the STOP-SAS with the clinician-rated Columbia Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). Validity was also assessed with the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) area of the STOP-SAS with the C-SSRS. Results: The STOP-SAS comprises 19 items in its adolescent, parent, and clinician versions, and 14 items in its children's version. Good internal consistency was found for adolescents (Cronbach's alpha: 0.965), children (Cronbach's alpha: 0.922), parents (Cronbach's alpha: 0.951) and clinicians (Cronbach's alpha: 0.955) versions. A strong correlation was found between the STOP-SAS and the C-SSRS for adolescents (r:0.670), parents (r:0.548), clinicians (r:0.863) and children (r:0.654). The ROC area was good for clinicians' (0.917), adolescents' (0.834) and parents' (0.756) versions but only fair (0.683) for children's version. Conclusions: The STOP-SAS is a comprehensive, web-based PROM developed on the HealthTrackerTM platform, and co-designed for use by adolescents, children, parents and clinicians. It allows the evaluation of aspects of suicidality and shows good reliability and validity. © 2016 The Author(s).;BMC Pediatrics;10.1186/s12887-016-0751-2;English;3;2;;0;0;;;;0;

In order to prevent suicidal and other self-injurious behaviors, research on the multiple factors involved in these behaviors with comprehensive and user-friendly instruments is necessary. The aim of the current study was to construct a self-report instrument with emphasis on items describing suicide-related behavior itself rather than strongly related clinical features on the basis of a general population study. Methods: Twelve items comprising a new scale were applied to 734 subjects from the general population (40.6% males and 59.4% females) aged 40.8 ± 11.5 along with the STAI and the CES-D. Results: The scoring method was developed on the basis of frequency table of responses to the individual scale items. The factor analysis returned 3 factors explaining 59.19% of total variance (Intention, Life, and History). The Cronbach's alpha was 0.85 for the Intention, 0.69 for the Life and 0.52 for the History subscale. Limitation: The findings need replication in clinical and epidemiologic studies.

However, no standardized measures exist to assess the degree to which individuals have disclosed suicide-related experiences. Therefore, the present study tested the psychometric properties of the Self-Harm and Suicide Disclosure Scale. A sample of 142 individuals, predominantly female and Caucasian, with ages ranging from 18–77 who had experienced suicidal ideation or behavior in their lifetime completed online surveys. A Rasch model analysis was used to test the item and individual separation and reliability and model fit of the instrument's use for disclosure to both family and nonfamily members. Analyses indicated strong item separation and reliability. Items were removed to improve model fit, resulting in two revised instruments. Findings indicate the Revised Suicide and Self-Harm Disclosure Scales are appropriate measures for assessing the depth of suicide-related disclosure. Future studies should attempt to replicate these findings with a more diverse sample. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.;Psychiatry Research;10.1016/j.psychres.2018.09.016;English;1;1;0;0;1;1;0;1;0;in the manuscript/SM

Therefore, for this purpose, this study presents the design and psychometric analysis of the Argentinean Scale of Suicidality for Adolescents (EASA-I by its Spanish acronym) Screening. It measures a specific dimension of suicidal ideation and five risk factors: Low self-esteem, negative perspective of the future, low emotion regulation, difficulties in problem-solving and lack of social support. This study was aimed at analyzing content construct and face validity, as well as convergent and discriminant validity evidence with external measures. Internal consistency of the scores was also examined. The sample was composed of 291 adolescents and young adults. Results suggest that the EASA-I constitutes a short and simple scale with adequate psychometric properties suitable to be used in different areas of application and research. © 2021 Asoc.

Studies have been hampered by the lack of a formal operational definition or measurement tool for chronic suicidal ideation (CSI). We sought to adapt a standardized measure of obsessive-compulsive thinking to rate chronic suicidal ideation in a mood disorder inpatient cohort. Method: We devised a novel self-report instrument, based on constructs related to obsessive-compulsive thinking and the Yale-Brown Obsessive-Compulsive Scale (Y-BOCS), as applied to preoccupations with suicidal thoughts and their persistence over 24 months in a previously described cohort of 97 inpatients with mood disorder. Exploratory factor analysis and principal components analysis were used to establish the factor structure of the instrument, and Cronbach's alpha and McDonald's omega were calculated to determine internal consistency of the scale. Results: Significant Pearson correlations with individual scale items and total CSI-5 scores were evident in relation to the 2-, 6-, 12- and 24-month periods preceding the index hospitalization. A one-factor solution explained 75% of the variance in total CSI-5 scores. Cronbach's alpha was 0.914, and McDonalds's omega was 0.916. CSI-5 scores were not significantly associated with current depression severity scores or actual past suicide attempts. Conclusions: This 5-item adaptation of Y-BOCS-type questions provides an internally consistent and reliable assessment of chronic suicidal ideation in patients with mood disorder. The integrated assessment of time occupied by suicidal thoughts, activity interference, associated distress, efforts to resist suicidal thoughts, and degree of control over suicidal thinking provides a cohesive framework for understanding chronic suicidal ideation. © 2022 Elsevier Ltd;Journal of Psychiatric Research;10.1016/j.jpsychires.2022.03.021;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Inter-rater reliability [Protocolo breve de evaluación del suicidio: Fiabilidad interexaminadores];"Introduction: Inter-rater agreement is a crucial aspect in the planning and performance of a clinical trial in which the main assessment tool is the clinical interview. The main objectives of this study are to study the inter-rater agreement of a tool for the assessment of suicidal behavior (Brief Suicide Questionnaire) and to examine whether the inter-examiner agreement when multiple ratings are made on a single subject is an efficient method to assess the reliability of an instrument. Method: In the context of designing a multicenter clinical trial, 32 psychiatrists assessed a videotaped clinical interview of a patient with suicidal behavior. In order to identify those items in which a greater level of discordance existed and detect the examiners whose ratings differed significantly from the average ratings, we used the DOMENIC method (Detecion of Multiple Examiners Not in Consensus). Results: Inter-rater agreement was between poor (<70%) to excelent (90-100%. Inter-rater agreement in Brugha's list of threatening experiences ranged from 75.5 and 100%; in the Global Assessment of Functioning (GAF) Scale was 82.58%; in the Beck's Suicidal Intent Scale, ranged from 67.5 and 97%; in the Beck's Scale for Suicide Ideation, ranged from 63.5 and 100%; and in the Lethality Rating Scale was 88.39%. On the whole, the level of agreement among raters, both in general scores and in particular items, was appropriate. Conclusion: The proposed design allows the assessment of the inter-rater agreement in an efficient way (only in one session). In addition, regarding the Brief Suicide Questionnaire, inter-raters agreement was appropriate. © 2011 SEP y SEPB.";Revista de Psiquiatria y Salud Mental;10.1016/j.rpsm.2011.10.001;Spanish;3;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM

A new measure, the Acquired Capability With Rehearsal for Suicide Scale (ACWRSS), was devised to capture the key facets of acquired capability-pain tolerance and fearlessness of death-while also incorporating deliberate and active means to increase preparedness for suicide. The factor structure of the ACWRSS was tested using confirmatory factor analysis (n = 611). The 7-item ACWRSS conformed to the hypothesized 3-factor structure, demonstrating excellent fit and good internal consistency (a =. 83). Measurement invariance across gender was also demonstrated on configural, metric, and scalar levels. Next, in the first longitudinal study of the association between acquired capability and suicide ideation, intention, and readiness (n = 234), the acquired capability facets prospectively predicted specific phases in the motivational-volitional pathway toward suicide readiness. Moreover, 2 of the acquired capability components mediated the relationship between baseline nonsuicidal self-injury and suicide readiness at follow-up. In an inpatient psychiatric sample (n = 108), the ACWRSS was significantly correlated with prior suicide attempts and thoughts and episodes of nonsuicidal self-injury, and its facets demonstrated differential sensitivity to change. The ACWRSS is the first measure of acquired capability that reliably and validly captures all key facets of this critical component of the interpersonal theory of suicide. Its brevity enhances its utility for both research and clinical settings. © 2016 American Psychological Association.;Psychological Assessment;10.1037/pas0000276;English;6;1;1;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM
128;2015;"Gipson, P.Y.; Agarwala, P.; Opperman, K.J.; Horwitz, A.; King, C.A.";Columbia-suicide severity rating scale: Predictive validity with adolescent psychiatric emergency patients;"OBJECTIVE: Despite the high prevalence of psychiatric emergency (PE) visits for attempted suicide and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI) among adolescents, we have limited information about assessment tools that are helpful in predicting subsequent risk for suicide attempts among adolescents in PE settings. This study examined the predictive validity of a highly promising instrument, the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS). METHOD: Participants were 178 adolescents (44.4% male; ages 13-17 years) seeking PE services. The C-SSRS interview and selected medical chart data were collected for the index visit and subsequent visits during a 1-year follow-up. RESULTS: A suicide risk concern was the most common chief complaint (50.6%) in this sample, and nearly one third of the adolescents (30.4%) reported a lifetime history of suicide attempt at index visit. Sixty-two adolescents (34.8%) had at least one return PE visit during follow-up. Lifetime history of NSSI predicted both return PE visits and a suicide attempt at return visit. The C-SSRS intensity scale score was a significant predictor of a suicide attempt at return visit for both the full sample of adolescents and the subsample who reported suicidal ideation at their index visit. In this subsample, one specific item on the intensity scale, duration, was also a significant predictor of both a return PE visit and a suicide attempt at return visit. CONCLUSIONS: The C-SSRS intensity scale and NSSI had predictive validity for suicide attempts at return visit. Results also suggest that duration of adolescents' suicidal thoughts may be particularly important to risk for suicidal behavior, warranting further study.

Suicidality is a major contributor to increased mortality. The International Suicide Prevention Trial (InterSePT) Scale for Suicidal Thinking (ISST) is a validated tool to assess current suicidal ideation in patients with schizophrenia. The aims of the study were to culturally adapt the Arabic translation of ISST and to examine the psychometric characteristics of the Arabic version of the ISST among patients with schizophrenia in Qatar. Methods: ISST was translated and adapted into formal Arabic using the back translation method. Patients diagnosed with schizophrenia were randomly recruited from the department of Psychiatry, Rumailah Hospital, Doha, Qatar. Healthy controls were randomly recruited from two primary health care centers in Doha, Qatar. The Arabic version of Module B for suicidality in Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview was used as the gold standard to which the Arabic ISST was compared. Results: The study sample (n=199) was composed of 100 patients diagnosed with schizophrenia (age 35.30±10.04years; M/F is 2/1) and 99 controls (age 33.98±8.33years; M/F is 2/3). The mean score on the ISST was 3.03±4.75 vs. 0.47±1.44 for the schizophrenia and control groups, respectively. Inter-rater reliability coefficient was 0.95, p>0.001. The overall Cronbach's alpha was 0.92. Principal Component Analysis produced 3 factors explaining a total of 73.8% of variance. Conclusions: This is the first study in the Arab countries to validate the Arabic version of the ISST. The psychometric properties indicate that the Arabic ISST is a valid tool to assess the severity of suicidal ideation in Arabic patients with schizophrenia. © 2016 The Author(s).";BMC Psychiatry;10.1186/s12888-016-1155-4;English;4;2;;0;0;;;;0;
9;2021;"Harris, K.; Haddock, G.; Peters, S.; Gooding, P.";Psychometric properties of the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) in a longitudinal sample of people experiencing non-affective psychosis;Background: Suicidal ideation is a key precursor for suicide attempts and suicide deaths. Performing routine screening of suicide precursors can help identify people who are at high risk of death by suicide. This is, arguably, an important suicide prevention effort. The aim of this study was to assess the validity, reliability, and factor structure of the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS) in a three-month longitudinal study with people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or non-affective psychosis and experiences of suicidal ideation and/or behaviours. It was predicted that the SIDAS would have high internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent, discriminant and construct validity. Methods: Ninety-nine participants experiencing psychosis completed the SIDAS at baseline and 89 participants completed it 3 months later. Additionally, participants completed a demographic questionnaire, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Defeat and Entrapment Scales. The internal consistency, test-retest reliability, convergent validity, and discriminant validity of the SIDAS were investigated in comparison to other constructs. Factor analysis was performed to examine the factor structure of the scale. Results: Principal component analysis yielded a theoretically coherent one-dimensional factor structure of SIDAS, suggesting good construct validity (PCA =.71). The SIDAS had high internal consistency (? =.89) and good test-retest reliability (? =.73). It was highly correlated with other self-report measures, including the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation, Beck Hopelessness Scale, Defeat and Entrapment scales, indicating excellent construct validity. Conclusion: The SIDAS is a valid and reliable self-report instrument for assessing the severity of suicidal ideation in a population of people with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or non-affective psychosis. Further research should test the psychometric properties of the scale in individuals experiencing different mental health problems in cross-cultural settings, in order to establish its broader validity, reliability, and clinical utility. © 2021, The Author(s).;BMC Psychiatry;10.1186/s12888-021-03639-8;English;3;2;;0;0;;;;0;

Methods: The English version of the YSAS, the Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire-Revised (SBQ-R), and Kessler’s K10 Psychological Distress Scale were distributed to 527 university students. Factor analysis was employed in the evaluation of its construct validity. The determination of the convergent and concurrent validity was determined by way of a bivariate correlation with the SBQ-R and Kessler’s K10 scales. Cronbach’s alpha and Receiver Operating Characteristic-analysis were also used to measure the internal consistency reliability as well as evaluate the screening properties of the scale. Results: The English YSAS and its ideation and attempt subdomains exhibited a high internal consistency value (>.8). The scale also had a cumulative variance of 76.39% and acceptable convergent and concurrent validity when compared to the SBQ-R and K10.

The aim of this study is to establish the first ever Malay version of suicide screening tool that is suitable and fit with multiracial and complex culture of Malaysia. Methods This study comprises of three phases, namely (1) items selection phase, (2) pilot study phase, and (3) scale validation phase. During the first phase, the items were selected from items pools which gathered from previous suicide ideation/ attitude scales. Then the pilot study was carried out to examine the items for Yatt Suicide Attitude Scale (YSAS). Lastly, the Yatt Suicide Attitude Scale (YSAS) validation study was conducted with 219 university students. Results Initial version of YSAS comprised 16 items and three components. After factor analysis, the questionnaire was reduced into only two components (Suicide Ideation and Suicide Attempt) with 5 items each. Both of the components obtained high reliability value (.89 and.86 respectively) and the questionnaire accounted for 67.84% of the total variance. Conclusion The analysis showed that YSAS has an acceptable reliability and validity for Malaysian population. Although these findings corroborate literature on development of suicide ideation assessment instrument for specific cultural context, there is a need to further examine its reliability with clinical population and general population of different cultural context in Malaysia. © 2019 Ibrahim et al.

The aim of this study was to linguistically adapt the measure and investigate reliability, validity, and factor structure of the Turkish version of the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale in a heterogeneous sample of psychiatric and nonpsychiatric outpatient adolescents. Method: The study included four clinical groups: two psychiatric, nonsuicidal outpatient groups (depression group (N = 50) and nondepression group (N = 50)), suicidal group (N = 43), and nonpsychiatric general practitioners’ group (N = 70). All participants were interviewed with the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale and suicidality module of the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview for children and adolescents. They also completed the Suicide Probability Scale, Child Depression Inventory, Beck Hopelessness Scale, and their parents filled in the Child Behavior Checklist. Results: The scale was found to be a solidly reliable measure with good internal consistency and agreement among interviewers. It correlated in the expected direction with self- and parent-report measures of associated constructs (e.g., depression) as well as suicidality. Consistent with the developers’ intent of theoretical subscales, a three-factor solution (i.e., the severity of suicidal ideation, the intensity of suicidal ideation, and suicidal behavior) fit the data well, and it fit the data significantly better than the alternative models. Last, the Turkish Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale successfully discriminated the adolescents with a recent history of suicide attempts from other clinical groups.

51;2017;"Kliem, S.; Lohmann, A.; Mößle, T.; Brähler, E.";German Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS): Psychometric properties from a representative population survey;"Background: Suicidal ideation has been identified as one of the major predictors of attempted or actual suicide. Routinely screening individuals for endorsing suicidal thoughts could save lives and protect many from severe psychological consequences following the suicide of loved ones. The aim of this study was to validate the German version of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSS) in a sample representative for the Federal Republic of Germany. Methods: All 2450 participants completed the first part of the Scale, the BSS-Screen. A risk group of n = 112 individuals (4.6%) with active or passive suicidal ideation was identified and subsequently completed the entire BSS. Results: Satisfactory internal reliability (? = .97 for the BSS-Screen; ? = .94 for the entire BSS) and excellent model fit indices for the one-dimensional factorial structure of the BSS-Screen (CFI = .998; TLI = .995; RMSEA = .045 [95%-CI:.030-.061]) were confirmed. Measurement invariance analyses supported strict invariance across gender, age, and depression status. We found correlations with related self-report measures in expected directions comparable to previous studies, indicating satisfactory construct validity. Limitations: Our study involved cross sectional data, hence neither predictive validity nor retest-reliability were examined. As only the risk group of n = 112 individuals completed the entire measure, confirmatory factor analyses could not be conducted for the full BSS. Conclusion: The German translation of the BSS is a reliable and valid instrument for assessing suicidal ideation in the general population. Using it as a screening device in general and specialized medical care could substantially advance suicide prevention. © 2017 The Author(s).";BMC Psychiatry;10.1186/s12888-017-1559-9;English;3;2;;0;0;;;;0;

This study describes the psychometric properties of a Norwegian language version of the Suicide Assessment Scale Self-report version (SUAS-S). Methods. Participants were fifty-two patients (mean age=39.3years, SD=10.7) with major depression (53.8%), bipolar disorder (25.0%) and/or a personality disorder (63.5%) referred to a psychiatric outpatient clinic. The SUAS-S, the screening section of the Beck Scale for Suicidal Ideation (BSS-5), the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI), Becks Hopelessness Scale (BHS), the Symptom Check-List-90 R (SCL-90R) and the Clinical Global Impression for Severity of Suicidality (CGI-SS) were administered. One week later, the patients completed the SUAS-S a second time. Results: Cronbachs alpha for SUAS-S was 0.88 and the test-retest reliability was 0.95 (95% CI: 0.93- 0.97). SUAS-S was positively correlated with the BSS-5 (r=0.66; 95% CI: 0.47-0.85) for the study sample as a whole and for the suicidal (r=0.52) and non-suicidal groups (r=0.50) respectively. There was no difference between the SUAS-S and the BSS-5 in the ability to identify suicidality. This ability was more pronounced when the suicide risk was high. There was a substantial intercorrelation between the score on the SUAS-S and the BDI (0.81) and the BHS (0.76). The sensitivity and specificity of the SUAS-S was explored and an appropriate clinical cut-off value was assessed. Conclusions: The study revealed good internal consistency, test-retest reliability and concurrent validity for the Suicide Assessment Scale Self-report version.

114;2016;"Kozel, B.; Grieser, M.; Abderhalden, C.; Cutcliffe, J.R.";Inter-rater reliability of the German version of the Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk scale;In comparison to the general population, the suicide rates of psychiatric inpatient populations in Germany and Switzerland are very high. An important preventive contribution to the lowering of the suicide rates in mental health care is to ensure that the risk of suicide of psychiatric inpatients is assessed as accurately as possible. While risk-assessment instruments can serve an important function in determining such risk, very few have been translated to German. Therefore, in the present study, we reported on the German version of Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk (NGASR) scale. After translating the original instrument into German and pretesting the German version, we tested the inter-rater reliability of the instrument. Twelve video case studies were evaluated by 13 raters with the NGASR scale in a 'laboratory' trial. In each case, the observer's agreement was calculated for the single items, the overall scale, the risk levels, and the sum scores. The statistical data analysis was conducted with kappa and AC1 statistics for dichotomous (items, scale) scales. A high-to-very high observers' agreement (AC1: 0.62-1.00, kappa: 0.00-1.00) was determined for 16 items of the German version of the NGASR scale. We conclude that the German version of the NGASR scale is a reliable instrument for evaluating risk factors for suicide. A reliable application in the clinical practise appears to be enhanced by training in the use of the instrument and the right implementation instructions. © 2016 Australian College of Mental Health Nurses Inc.;International journal of mental health nursing;10.1111/inm.12193;English;3;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

The predictive properties of the C-SSRS have mainly been evaluated in young US populations. We wanted to examine the instrument's predictive validity in a Swedish cohort of adults seeking psychiatric emergency services after an episode of self-harm. Methods: Prospective cohort study of patients (n = 804) presenting for psychiatric emergency assessment after an episode of self-harm with or without suicidal intent. Suicidal ideation and behaviours at baseline were rated with the C-SSRS and subsequent non-fatal and fatal suicide attempts within 6 months were identified by record review. Logistic regression was used to evaluate separate ideation items and total scores as predictors of non-fatal and fatal suicide attempts. Receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curves were constructed for the suicidal ideation (SI) intensity score and the C-SSRS total score. Results: In this cohort, the median age at baseline was 33 years, 67% were women and 68% had made at least one suicide attempt prior to the index attempt. At least one non-fatal or fatal suicide attempt was recorded during follow-up for 165 persons (20.5%). The single C-SSRS items frequency, duration and deterrents were associated with this composite outcome; controllability and reasons were not. In a logistic regression model adjusted for previous history of suicide attempt, SI intensity score was a significant predictor of a non-fatal or fatal suicide attempt (OR 1.08; 95% CI 1.03-1.12). ROC analysis showed that the SI intensity score was somewhat better than chance in correctly classifying the outcome (AUC 0.62, 95% CI 0.57-0.66). The corresponding figures for the C-SSRS total score were 0.65, 95% CI 0.60-0.69. Conclusions: The C-SSRS items frequency, duration and deterrents were associated with elevated short term risk in this adult psychiatric cohort, as were both the SI intensity score and the C-SSRS total score. However, the ability to correctly predict future suicidal behaviour was limited for both scores. © 2018 The Author(s).";BMC Psychiatry;10.1186/s12888-018-1883-8;English;3;2;;0;0;;;;0;

124;2015;"Millner, A.J.; Lee, M.D.; Nock, M.K.";Single-item measurement of suicidal behaviors: Validity and consequences of misclassification;Suicide is a leading cause of death worldwide. Although research has made strides in better defining suicidal behaviors, there has been less focus on accurate measurement. Currently, the widespread use of self-report, single-item questions to assess suicide ideation, plans and attempts may contribute to measurement problems and misclassification. We examined the validity of single-item measurement and the potential for statistical errors. Over 1,500 participants completed an online survey containing single-item questions regarding a history of suicidal behaviors, followed by questions with more precise language, multiple response options and narrative responses to examine the validity of single-item questions. We also conducted simulations to test whether common statistical tests are robust against the degree of misclassification produced by the use of single-items. We found that 11.3% of participants that endorsed a single-item suicide attempt measure engaged in behavior that would not meet the standard definition of a suicide attempt. Similarly, 8.8% of those who endorsed a single-item measure of suicide ideation endorsed thoughts that would not meet standard definitions of suicide ideation. Statistical simulations revealed that this level of misclassification substantially decreases statistical power and increases the likelihood of false conclusions from statistical tests. Providing a wider range of response options for each item reduced the misclassification rate by approximately half. Overall, the use of single-item, self-report questions to assess the presence of suicidal behaviors leads to misclassification, increasing the likelihood of statistical decision errors. Improving the measurement of suicidal behaviors is critical to increase understanding and prevention of suicide. © 2015 Millner et al.

Short-form scales are important tools for use in the assessment of suicide ideation and risk since their brevity makes them ideally suited for use in busy practice settings. This article reports results of a validity study of an ultra-short suicidal ideation scale (USSIS) used with an older adult population. The study tests the hypothesis that scores on the USSIS represent magnitude of suicidal thinking. The USSIS was used to gather data on more than 200 adults, ages 50 to 97 years, recruited from 2 clinical settings that serve older adults. The data are analyzed to provide evidence for concurrent criterion, divergent, factorial, and known-groups discriminant validity. In addition, we conducted analyses to test measurement equivalence across the 2 study sites. Results are consistent with the scores on the USSIS representing magnitude of suicidal ideation, and with measurement equivalence across the study sites. © 2014 by the Society for Social Work and Research.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the psychometric properties in bipolar disorder of the 7- and 12-item versions of the Concise Health Risk Tracking Self-Report (CHRT-SR), a scale measuring suicidal ideation, suicidal behavior, and associated symptoms. Methods: The CHRT was administered to 283 symptomatic outpatients with bipolar I or II disorder who were randomized to receive lithium plus optimized personalized treatment (OPT), or OPT without lithium in a six month longitudinal comparative effectiveness trial. Participants were assessed using structured diagnostic interviews, clinician-rated assessments, and self-report questionnaires. Results: The internal consistency (Cronbach ?) was 0.80 for the 7-item CHRT-SR and 0.90 for the 12-item CHRT-SR with a consistent factor structure, and three independent factors (current suicidal thoughts and plans, hopelessness, and perceived lack of social support) for the 7-item version. CHRT-SR scores are correlated with measures of depression, functioning, and quality of life, but not with mania scores. Conclusions: The 7- and 12-item CHRT-SR both had excellent psychometric properties in a sample of symptomatic subjects with bipolar disorder. The scale is highly correlated with depression, functioning, and quality of life, but not with mania. Future research is needed to determine whether the CHRT-SR will be able to predict suicide attempts in clinical practice. © 2015 .;Journal of Psychiatric Research;10.1016/j.jpsychires.2015.10.004;English;1;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM

We hope that establishing the validity and reliability of the BSSI can improve the detection of suicidal ideation. Methods: The sample for this study consisted of 120 individuals who participated voluntarily. One hundred of the 120 participants were administered related relevant instruments, the Beck Depression Inventory [BDI], Beck Anxiety Inventory [BAI], Beck Hopelessness Scale [BHS], and Suicidal Ideation Scale [SIS], to determine concurrent validity. Separately, two clinicians interviewed twenty different participants to assess inter-rater reliability. To assess internal consistency, Cronbach’s alpha coefficients were computed. In addition, a principal component analysis with a Varimax rotation was performed to examine the test’s factor structure. Results: Cronbach’s alpha value was 0.84 and every item was positively correlated to the total scores on the BSSI. Inter-rater correlation was very strong and significant (r=0.94, p<0.01). Correlation coefficients for similar measures showed significant results [i.e., SIS (r=0.40) and BHS (r=0.58)]. There was a mild correlation between the BSSI and BDI (r=0.40) but no correlation with the BAI. Conclusion: The BSSI is a valid and reliable measure that has good potential to detect suicidal ideation and behavior in clinical settings when compared to other self-rating measures. These results suggest that measuring suicidal ideation and behaviors using the BSSI across different diagnoses may provide valuable information for clinical research. © 2015 Cukurova Univ Tip Fakultesi Psikiyatri Anabilim Dali.;Klinik Psikofarmakoloji Bulteni;10.5455/bcp.20141214105009;English;4;2;;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM

Although there are many studies addressing suicide in the psychiatric unit, little is known about suicide in a medical setting. This study included the development and validation of a screening tool for the assessment of suicide risk, specialized for medical inpatients. Methods: The preliminary questionnaire was based on review of previous suicide ideation scales, mood scales, and clinical experiences of psychiatrists and clinical psychologists in Korea. Initially, the questionnaire consisted of 12 questions. One hundred adult medical inpatients were asked to perform the questionnaire. Explorative factor analysis was used to examine construct validity. Concurrent validity was evaluated by comparison with the Korean versions of the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSI), the Beck Hopelessness Scale (BHS), and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results: Five questions were removed from the preliminary questionnaire by explorative factor analysis and seven questions remained to comprise the Suicide Risk Scale for Medical inpatients (SRSM). Explorative factor analysis showed that the SRSM is composed of a single factor. SRSM was highly reliable in terms of internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha 0.91). Concurrent validity with the BSI, BHS, and HADS was statistically significant. The proposed cut-off score of the SRSM was five. Conclusion: In conclusion, the SRSM is a valid and reliable measure for screening suicide risks in medical inpatients. © 2018 The Korean Academy of Medical Sciences.;Journal of Korean Medical Science;10.3346/jkms.2018.33.e18;English;4;2;;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM

This study set out to evaluate the reliability, convergent and divergent validity of the S-STS in a sample of college students, a population with a high risk of completed and attempted suicide. Methods Cross-sectional, survey design. Participants (303 undergraduate students; males: 42%) completed several measures assessing psychological distress (General Health Questionnaire; GHQ); self-esteem (Rosenberg Self Esteem Scale; RSES); social support (Modified Social Support Survey; MOSSS); and suicidal behavior, including ideation and attempts (S-STS). Results Both internal consistency and test-retest stability were excellent for the S-STS-global score. The S-STS subscale on suicide ideation also showed good reliability, while the subscale on suicidal behavior showed some inconsistency at retest. Convergent and divergent validity of S-STS was confirmed. All S-STS items loaded on a single factor, which had an excellent fit for the unidimensional model, thus justifying the use of the S-STS as a screening tool. In a mediation model, self-esteem and social support explained 45% of the effects of psychological distress on suicide ideation and behavior as measured by the S-STS-global score. Conclusions This study provided promising evidence on the convergent, divergent, internal consistency and test-retest stability of the Sheehan Suicidality Tracking Scale. The cross-sectional design and lack of measures of hopelessness and helplessness prevent any conclusion about the links of suicidal behavior with self-esteem and social support. © 2013 Elsevier Inc.

There is, however, a lack of developmentally sensitive valid and reliable instruments that can capture data on risk, and clinical and psychosocial mediators of suicidality in young people. In this study, we aimed to develop and assess the validity of instruments evaluating the psychosocial risk and protective factors for suicidal behaviours in the adolescent population. In Phase 1, based on a systematic literature review of suicidality, focus groups, and expert panel advice, the risk factors and protective factors (resilience factors) were identified and the adolescent, parent, and clinician versions of the STOP-Suicidality Risk Factors Scale (STOP-SRiFS) and the Resilience Factors Scale (STOP-SReFS) were developed. Phase 2 involved instrument validation and comprised of two samples (Sample 1 and 2). Sample 1 consisted of 87 adolescents, their parents/carers, and clinicians from the various participating centres, and Sample 2 consisted of three sub-samples: adolescents (n = 259) who completed STOP-SRiFS and/or the STOP-SReFS scales, parents (n = 213) who completed one or both of the scales, and the clinicians who completed the scales (n = 254). The STOP-SRiFS demonstrated a good construct validity—the Cronbach Alpha for the adolescent (? = 0.864), parent (? = 0.842), and clinician (? = 0.722) versions of the scale. Test–retest reliability, inter-rater reliability, and content validity were good for all three versions of the STOP-SRiFS. The sub-scales generated using Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) were the (1) anxiety and depression risk, (2) substance misuse risk, (3) interpersonal risk, (4) chronic risk, and (5) risk due to life events. For the STOP-SRiFS, statistically significant correlations were found between the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS) total score and the adolescent, parent, and clinical versions of the STOP-SRiFS sub-scale scores. The STOP-SRiFS showed good psychometric properties. This study demonstrated a good construct validity for the STOP-SReFS—the Cronbach Alpha for the three versions were good (adolescent: ? = 0.775; parent: ? = 0.808; ? = clinician: 0.808). EFA for the adolescent version of the STOP-SReFS, which consists of 9 resilience factors domains, generated two factors (1) interpersonal resilience and (2) cognitive resilience. The STOP-SReFS Cognitive Resilience sub-scale for the adolescent was negatively correlated (r = ? 0.275) with the C-SSRS total score, showing that there was lower suicidality in those with greater Cognitive Resilience. The STOP-SReFS Interpersonal resilience sub-scale correlations were all negative, but none of them were significantly different to the C-SSRS total scores for either the adolescent, parent, or clinician versions of the scales. This is not surprising, because the items in this sub-scale capture a much larger time-scale, compared to the C-SSRS rating period. The STOP-SReFS showed good psychometric properties. The STOP-SRiFS and STOP-SReFS are instruments that can be used in future studies about suicidality in children and adolescents. © 2019, The Author(s).";European Child and Adolescent Psychiatry;10.1007/s00787-019-01328-2;English;3;2;;0;0;;;;0;

Research on suicide-specific rumination has been hindered by the lack of an independent measurement tool. This article presents the development and validation of a self-report measure of suicide-specific rumination across several samples with lifetime suicidal ideation (Sample 1: N = 494 students; Sample 2: N = 219 community members; Sample 3: N = 128 adults at high risk for suicide). The Suicide Rumination Scale (SRS) item pool was reduced from a pool of 41 items to 8 items that are highly discriminant and of varying levels of difficulty. The SRS demonstrated measurement invariance, convergent validity, and nonredundancy with related measures. Importantly, the SRS differentiated suicide attempters from ideators, suggesting its potential clinical relevance. Overall, these findings suggest that the SRS is a valid and incrementally useful measure of suicide-specific rumination. © The Author(s) 2021.";Assessment;10.1177/10731911211033897;English;1;2;;0;0;;;;0;
66;2021;"Rudd, M.D.; Bryan, C.J.";The Brief Suicide Cognitions Scale: Development and Clinical Application;The study explored the development of the Brief Suicide Cognitions Scale (B-SCS), a simple and brief measure of suicide risk. The B-SCS provides a brief measure that captures critical aspects of suicide risk embedded in core beliefs about the self as unlovable, one's emotional experience as unbearable, and life problems as unsolvable (i.e., the suicidal belief system), resulting in chronic or enduring suicide risk and heightened vulnerability for acute episodes secondary to internal and external triggers. Data were analyzed from three diverse samples, including a student sample (N = 349), an inpatient psychiatric sample (N = 160), and a sample of emergency department (ED) patients presenting secondary to a suicidal crisis (N = 94). Those in the student and inpatient samples completed additional symptom measures (hopelessness, anxiety, depression) and the ED sample provided 6-month follow-up data for suicide attempts. Reliability (internal consistency, test-retest), concurrent validity, construct (divergent, convergent) validity, factorial, incremental, and predictive validity were evaluated, along with calculation of predictive value of negative and positive tests, sensitivity, and specificity estimates. The B-SCS demonstrated good reliability and validity, a unidimensional factor structure across samples, along with good predictive validity and value in real-world clinical settings. The B-SCS is a brief, reliable and valid measure of suicide risk, with good ability to identify those with enduring risk for subsequent suicide attempts. The B-SCS offers a unique contribution to understanding and assessing the nature of suicide risk over time targeting the suicidal belief system, with easy application across inpatient and outpatient clinical settings, and good predictive value. © Copyright © 2021 Rudd and Bryan.;Frontiers in Psychiatry;10.3389/fpsyt.2021.737393;English;1;2;;0;0;;;;0;

The psychometric properties of the 12-item Concise Health Risk Tracking Scale Self-Report (CHRT-SR), a measure that was created to assess suicidal thinking and several factors associated with a propensity to act, has been established in persons with mood disorders. This is a secondary analysis to assess the CHRT-SR in 302 stimulant abusing patients that had participated in a clinical trial. A confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) was conducted to assess the factor validity of the 12-item CHRT-SR model with a second-order Propensity factor. The CHRT-SR total score and 2 factor scores (Propensity and Suicidal Thoughts) demonstrated acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliabilities. These two subscales and the total score were modestly but significantly associated with measures of depression and life satisfaction, demonstrating construct validity. Two additional items assessing Impulsivity were also analyzed, and demonstrated acceptable internal consistency, test-retest reliability, and construct validity.

Existing measures of the content of SICs provide varying coverage, highlighting a lack of consensus regarding which cognitions characterize SIB. Additionally, a central, unresolved conceptual and measurement issue concerns whether to conceptualize suicide attempts (SA) and nonsuicidal self-injury (NSSI), 2 forms of SIB, as separate constructs. We developed the Suicide Attempt Beliefs Scale (SABS) and the Nonsuicidal Self-Injury Beliefs Scale (NSIBS) to clarify which SICs characterize SA and NSSI and what factor structure best explains SA and NSSI cognitions. A series of factor analyses across 6 samples (N 3,313) revealed that the SABS consists of 7 correlated factors and the NSIBS consists of 10 correlated factors. Both instruments contain factors that describe how SIB relates to oneself and others and demonstrate moderate to excellent test-retest reliability over 2-4 weeks and strong internal consistency; 95% of the correlations between SABS and NSIBS subscales were r.5. Both instruments demonstrated small to moderate-sized correlations with a range of clinical variables, measures of well-being, and purportedly similar, existing SIB constructs. Various analyses indicate that SA and NSSI SICs are similar but distinct phenomena, supporting the use of separate terminology and definitions of SA and NSSI, and pointing to the importance of separating SA and NSSI in research and clinical practice. We hope that the development of the SABS and NSIBS may unify the field somewhat in its understanding and measurement of the basic constituent elements of SICs. © 2018 American Psychological Association.";Psychological Assessment;10.1037/pas0000684;English;3;1;1;0;1;1;0;1;0;in the manuscript/SM

Validity and reliability were established in an outpatient- (n = 277) and in an inpatient sample (n = 75). Statistical analyses included confirmatory factor analyses, correlation analyses, between-group comparison by history of lifetime suicide attempts, and regression analyses. The three-factor model showed good model fit for the long version of the SCS (SCS-18). For the short version of the SCS (SCS-9), a bifactor model yielded the best fit. Overall, the total scale of the SCS-18 and the SCS-9 and the subscales of the SCS-18 showed satisfactory internal consistency, as well as good convergent validity. The SCS-18 subscales and the SCS-9 demonstrated clinical utility by differentiating between participants with prior and without prior suicide attempts. The SCS (subscale unsolvability and SCS-9 score) predicted current suicide ideation as well as suicide ideation 7–10 days later – even after controlling for established risk-factors (e.g., depression, hopelessness, interpersonal variables). Results suggest that the SCS-18 and the SCS-9 are reliable and valid measures to assess suicidal cognitions that can be used in clinical as well as in research settings. © 2019;Psychiatry Research;10.1016/j.psychres.2019.02.047;English;3;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM

The objective was to establish the adaptation, construct validity and reliability of the scale in Colombian adolescents in Colombian adolescents. An instrumental study was designed, in a sample made up of 481 adolescents with age between 13 and 20 years (M = 16.3, SD = 1.4), 46% corresponded to men. Exploratory Factor Analysis evaluated the construct validity and the number of factors was defined with the Horn Parallel Analysis and the adjustment with Confirmatory Factor Analysis. A reduced version of nine items was obtained grouped into two factors that explained 53% of the common variance and very good fit [ x2S-B = 26.36, gl = 26, p = 0.34; NNFI = 1.0, CFI = 1.0, RMSEA = 0.02, IC 90% (0.00, 0.05)]. The items discriminated between those who attempted suicide and those who had not tried. Cronbach’s alpha reliability for depression was .72 and .80 for suicidal risk, McDonald’s Omega was .82 and .94 respectively. It is concluded that the new reduced version of nine items of the Plutchik suicide risk scale has adequate psychometric characteristics and its use is recommended in the assessment of suicide risk in colombian adolescents. © 2019 Fundación Universitaria Konrad Lorenz.";Revista Latinoamericana de Psicologia;10.14349/rlp.2019.v51.n3.1;Spanish;2;2;;0;0;;;;0;

Our objective was to build a multidimensional scale namely “Suicidality of Adolescent Screening Scale (SASS)” to identify adolescents at risk of suicide. An initial pool of items was developed by using in-depth interview, focus groups and a literature review. Initially, 77 items were administered to 307 adolescents and analyzed using the exploratory Multidimensional Item Response Theory (MIRT) to remove unnecessary items. A subsequent exploratory factor analysis revealed 35 items that collected into 4 factors: Stressors, Pessimism, Suicidality and Depression. To confirm this structure, a new sample of 450 adolescents were collected and confirmatory MIRT factor analysis was performed.

Many different instruments are in use, among which are some that are not properly psychometrically investigated. Aim: The aim of this study is to establish the psychometric properties of the Dutch version of the Nurses' Global Assessment of Suicide Risk scale (NGASR), and the feasibility of its use in assessing suicide risk. Therefore, our research questions are as follows: what is the reliability, validity, interpretability and feasibility of the NGASR Methods: A psychometric study of acceptability, reliability and predictive validity among 252 patients making use of a concurrent instrument, the Suicide Intention Scale (SIS), concurrent assessment by a physician and 6-month follow-up. Results: Factor analysis identified five factors. Cronbach's alpha was .45. Intraclass correlation was .92 (95% confidence interval (CI) =85-95). Association between total NGASR and SIS was substantial and significant (B = 0.66, standard error of mean (SE) = 0.19, = .66, p = .003). NGASR total score had a significant and moderately strong association with judgement by a physician on ""suicidal thoughts' (odds ratio (OR) = 1.24, p = < .001) or ""suicidal thoughts or plans' (OR = 1.35, p = .001). No significant association of NGASR scores and 6-month follow-up of suicidality was found. Conclusions: Internal consistency of the NGASR and most of the subscales identified was low. Other indicators of reliability of the NGASR were sufficient, although predictive validity was poor.

A 25-item SSQ-SR is a newly developed suicide screening tool that measures suicide risk factors, including a history of suicidal thoughts and behaviors (STBs), life stress, and mental health problems. To investigate the reliability and validity of the SSQ-SR, we conducted a longitudinal case-control study with adults with and without STBs in the past six months. A total of 176 participants were recruited through 12 hospital-based Crisis Response Centers across South Korea. At the baseline, we administered the SSQ-SR, the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI), and the Patient Health Questionnaire-9 (PHQ-9). In a 6-months follow-up, we investigated whether the participants engaged in suicidal ideation, plan, or attempt since the baseline assessment. As a result, the SSQ-SR demonstrated a strong internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.96). In addition, the total score of SSQ-SR had concurrent validity compared to the total scores of the BSSI and the PHQ-9. In comparing the suicidal groups with the control group, the ROC analysis indicated the optimal cut point at 31 with a sensitivity rate of 0.97 and a specificity rate of 0.98. Through explanatory factor analysis, two factors were identified: Mental Health and Environmental Factors and Active Suicidal Thoughts and Behaviors. The SSQ-SR total and sub-factor scores were prospectively associated with subsequent suicidal ideation, plan, and attempt. These findings support that the SSQ-SR is a promising tool in prospectively screening those who are at risk of suicidal thoughts, plans, and nonfatal attempts. © 2022 The Authors;Comprehensive Psychiatry;10.1016/j.comppsych.2022.152360;English;4;2;;0;0;;;;0;

To investigate the psychometric properties of the five-item Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire (SBQ-5) and the Geriatric Suicide Ideation Scale-Screen (GSIS-Screen, submitted) among community-residing middle-aged and older men. Methods. The SBQ-5 and GSIS-Screen were administered to 93 men, 55 years or older, who participated in an eligibility assessment (Time 1) for an upstream psychological intervention study to prevent the onset of suicide ideation among men struggling to transition to retirement. Eligible participants later completed the full GSIS and measures of depression and hopelessness at a pre-group assessment (Time 2). Results. The SBQ-5 was positively associated with the GSIS-Screen at the eligibility assessment. Internal consistency for both measures was low but acceptable. Time 1 scores on both screens predicted suicide ideation at Time 2, controlling for the intervening time lag and for baseline cognitive and physical functioning. Only the GSIS-Screen uniquely predicted future depression and hopelessness ratings. Conclusions. The SBQ-5 and the GSIS-Screen have acceptable psychometric properties among middle-aged and older community-residing men; the GSIS-Screen is more closely associated with later-life suicide risk factors.

Participants (n = 102 autistic adults; 58% women, 34% men, 8% nonbinary; Mage = 41.75, SD = 12.89) completed an online survey including the SIDAS-M at Time 1 and participated in follow-up interviews at Time 2 (~111 days later). A single factor solution provided good to excellent fit to the data (comparative fit index = 0.961, Tucker–Lewis index = 0.921; standardized root mean square residual = 0.027), with all items showing good to excellent loadings (0.74–0.91). SIDAS-M total score (?=.930, bias-corrected and accelerated 95% confidence interval (BCa 95% CI) [.90,.95]) demonstrated good convergent validity, correlating significantly with existing suicide specific (?=.442–.698, p<.001) and well-being measures (?=.325.–.505, p?.001), and good divergent validity. Logistic regression controlling for age, gender, and relationship status indicated that SIDAS-M scores at Time 1 significantly predicted suicidal behavior at Time 2, ? = 0.462, p < 0.001, [0.032, 0.068]. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis indicated SIDAS-M has utility discriminating between participants classified at low or above low risk, area under the curve = 0.866, [0.767, 0.966], p < 0.001, with a cutoff score ?1 providing a potentially useful indicator of increased suicidal risk. Overall, SIDAS-M demonstrated good psychometric properties when used with autistic adults without intellectual disability. Lay Abstract: Autistic people may be at higher risk of suicidal behavior than people in the general population. Suicidal behavior may include thinking about suicide or attempting to end one’s own life by suicide. It is important to identify autistic people who may be thinking about suicide. People who are at risk of suicidal behavior can be identified by asking questions about whether they have been thinking about suicide. A specially designed questionnaire, or screening instrument, can help someone ask the best questions to find out if someone has been thinking about suicide. This information can help to identify supports to be put in place to prevent suicidal behavior, such as a suicide attempt. However, autistic people may interpret questions differently than non-autistic people. It is important to use screening tools that have been designed with, and for autistic people. In this study, we examined the Suicidal Ideation Attributes Scale (SIDAS). The SIDAS is an existing tool that was developed to screen for suicidal thinking in the general population. We modified SIDAS for use with autistic adults. We involved autistic people in the process of modifying SIDAS. We called the modified instrument the SIDAS-M. The results of our study showed SIDAS-M may be useful for screening for suicidal thinking in autistic adults who do not have an intellectual disability. © The Author(s) 2022.";Autism;10.1177/13623613221131234;English;6;1;0;0;1;1;0;1;0;in the manuscript/SM

The Suicide Cognitions Scale (SCS) was designed to assess suicide risk by measuring a range of suicidogenic cognitions (e.g., hopelessness, perceived burdensomeness) collectively referred to as the suicidal belief system. The SCS’s concurrent, known groups, and prospective validity for suicidal thoughts and behaviors have previously been supported. The present study examined the factor structure, known-groups, and concurrent validity of a revised, 16-item version of the SCS (SCS-R), which removed two items that explicitly used the word “suicide” and changed item scoring from a 1–5 to 0–4 scale, thereby improving the interpretation of scores. In a sample of 2,690 primary care patients presenting for routine medical care at one of six US military clinics, results of bifactor analysis supported the scale’s unidimensionality. The SCS-R significantly differentiated participants with a history of suicide attempts and was significantly correlated with frequency of thoughts about death and self-harm during the previous 2 weeks. Results align with earlier research and provide psychometric support for the SCS-R. © 2021 Society for Military Psychology, Division 19 of the American Psychological Association.;Military Psychology;10.1080/08995605.2021.1897498;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Methods: A series of psychometric analyses was conducted, assessing the internal consistency, test–retest reliability, construct and predictive validity of the abbreviated GSIS scales. This was done by selecting-out GSIS items from a combined dataset of studies on suicide ideation in older adults: 1) The GSIS scale development study (n = 107); 2) A clinical trial of Interpersonal Psychotherapy (IPT) modified for suicidal older adults(n = 25); 3) A longitudinal study of risk and resiliency to suicide ideation in community-residing older adults (n = 173). Results: Overall findings demonstrated strong internal consistency, test–retest reliability, concurrent and predictive validity for the BGSIS and GSIS-Screen with older adults across community, clinical, and residential settings.

Even large RCTs may not stipulate suicide death as the primary outcome, as suicide death is relatively uncommon. Therefore, RCTs may need to specify suicidal ideation as a proxy indicator of risk. There is no consensus on the best tool for measuring suicidal ideation within RCTs. We contrasted the psychometric performance of three suicidal ideation measures to address this need. Methods: We applied item response theory to the Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation (BSSI), the Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale (C-SSRS), and the suicide item of the Hamilton Rating Scale for Depression (HRSD) for 101 outpatients with depression and suicidal ideation participating in a RCT with suicidal ideation as the primary outcome. Results: All measures of suicidal ideation were equally able to detect low and very high levels of suicidal ideation. Conclusions: The choice of the specific measure of suicidal ideation in a clinical trial may be dictated by time and financial resources versus the need for granularity in the interpretation of the scores. © 2021 The American Association of Suicidology;Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior;10.1111/sltb.12791;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Most of the measures used were developed, normed, and validated for use with civilians. Although there is reason to believe such measures will perform similarly in civilian and military treatment settings, that assumption has rarely been confirmed empirically. The purpose of the current study was to examine data from a large assessment study to confirm the reliability and validity of 4 widely used suicide risk assessment measures for military personnel. The risk assessment measures were (a) Columbia-Suicide Severity Rating Scale; (b) Self-Harm Behavior Questionnaire; (c) Suicidal Behaviors Questionnaire—Revised; and (d) Beck Scale for Suicide Ideation. Items from the Military Suicide Research Consortium’s Common Data Elements were used to examine convergent validity. Data from 1,044 military service members at risk for suicide who completed baseline assessments were used in the current analyses. Small differences were found across the measures, but overall performance was acceptable and all are considered valid and reliable to use when assessing active duty U.S. military personnel. © 2019, © 2019 Taylor & Francis Group, LLC.";Military Behavioral Health;10.1080/21635781.2018.1562390;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

As such, this study replicated and extended previous psychometric research on the SCS-R in an online survey study with a community sample of N = 10,625 U.S. adults. Results confirmed the unidimensional structure of the SCS-R.

We assessed the internal consistency of the GSIS and its four component subscales, and its shorter and longer duration test-retest reliability, convergent (depression, social hopelessness, and loneliness), divergent (psychological well-being, life satisfaction, perceived social support, and self-rated health), discriminant (basic and instrumental activities of daily living and social desirability), criterion (history of suicide behavior), and predictive validity (future suicide ideation).Results: The GSIS demonstrated strong test-retest reliability and internal consistency. Baseline GSIS scores were significantly positively associated with suicide risk factors, negatively associated with potential resiliency factors, and not associated with functional impairment or social desirability. GSIS scores significantly differentiated between participants with as compared to those without a history of suicide behavior. Baseline GSIS scores significantly predicted suicide ideation at a 2+ year follow-up assessment.Conclusion: Findings suggest strong measurement characteristics for the GSIS with community-residing older adults, including impressive consistency over time.

Psychometrically sound instruments are required to reliably measure suicide ideation and risk of self-harm for older adults with BD. For this study, we validate the geriatric suicide ideation scale (GSIS) with adults 50+ years with BD. Methods: We recruited a global sample of 220 older adults with BD (M = 58.50 years of age) over 19 days using socio-demographically targeted, social media advertising and online data collection. To demonstrate the construct validation of GSIS responses by older adults with BD, we computed correlations and performed regression analyses to identify predictors of suicide ideation. Results: Our analyses support a four-factor model of responses to the GSIS (ideation, death ideation, loss of personal and social worth, and perceived meaning in life) measuring a higher order latent construct. Older adults with BD reporting low satisfaction with life and current depressive symptoms, and who misuse alcohol, report significantly higher levels of suicide ideation. Sleep quality and cognitive failures are also correlated with GSIS responses. Conclusions: Results support the factorial validity of the GSIS with older adults with BD. Similar to other populations, the GSIS measures a four-factor structure of suicide ideation.

The development process includes item generation, item revision and refinement, and validation. A total sample of 2,238 adults in South Korea was used for analysis. The results of factor analysis showed that the SSQ-SR, containing 25 items, supported a three-factor model: “Situational factors,” “Negative self-perceptions and mental health factors,” and “Suicidal thoughts and behaviors.” Also, SSQ-SR showed satisfying internal consistency, concurrent validity and discriminant validity. Lastly, the results of ROC analysis showed a cut-off point of 33.5 for the low-risk group and 36.5 for the high-risk group. Considering these results, the current results demonstrate the SSQ-SR is a valid scale and therefore can contribute to future suicide-related studies and prevention. © The Author(s) 2022.;Omega (United States);10.1177/00302228221119029;English;4;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Methods: The SIS-K was translated into Korean using a translation and back-translation technique. A sample of 396 patients with mental disorders was recruited from regional mental health centres in Korea. Factorial-construct validity was tested using both exploratory factor analysis (EFA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA). The data were randomly split into two subsamples: one used for EFA to identify the underlying structure of the items, and the other used for CFA to test whether the underlying structure was supported by actual data. Convergent validity, known-groups validity and internal-consistency reliability were tested. Results: Exploratory factor analysis extracted nine items clustered into two subscales that accounted for 68.59% of the variance. One item (‘I feel there is no solution to my problems other than taking my own life’) was deleted. The structure of the two subscales was supported by CFA. The SIS-K score was moderately correlated with depression, and the scale demonstrated convergent validity. The SIS-K scores were significantly higher in patients who had attempted suicide, implying the presence of satisfactory known-groups validity. Cronbach's alpha of the total SIS-K was 0.91. Conclusions: The study has demonstrated the excellent psychometric properties of the SIS-K.

Methods: The reliability and validity of SIQ were analyzed with data of 505 high school students in Jinan, China. Results: The Cronbach's coefficient alpha of SIQ was above 0.95 and the Cronbach's coefficients alphas of SIQ when each item was deleted were relatively stable. The convergent validity analyses showed that there were statistically significant correlations between SIQ total scores and DSD total scores by gender. Exploratory factor analysis produced four factors of SIQ. Conclusion: The SIQ has a high level of reliability and validity and should be a reliable measure for suicide ideation in Chinese high school students. © 2014, Baywood Publishing Co., Inc.;Omega (United States);10.2190/OM.70.2.c;English;4;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Given the Columbia- Suicide Severity Rating Scale's (C-SSRS) emerging ""goldstandard"" status for risk assessment, studies are needed to assess its psychometric properties, particularly predictive validity. The current study adds to the limited literature by assessing the C-SSRS's internal consistency, factor structure, concurrent validity, and predictive validity. Methods: In this longitudinal study of 1,055 adults with DSM-IV diagnoses consecutively admitted to a specialized psychiatric hospital between July 1, 2012, and June 30, 2014, patients completed standardized assessments, including the C-SSRS, at admission and 2, 12, and 24 weeks postdischarge. Results: The C-SSRS evidenced excellent internal consistency (ordinal ? = .95). Principal components analysis (PCA) revealed a 2-factor solution, accounting for 65.3% of the variance across items. The severity of ideation and behavioral items loaded onto the first factor, and the intensity of ideation items loaded onto the second factor. The total score, factors, and the most severe ideation single item were moderately correlated with other measures of suicidality (0.27 ? r ? 0.58; P < .0001). The summary score from the ideation/behavior factor was found to be modestly correlated with any suicide-related behavior within the 6 months following hospitalization. Receiver operator characteristics indicated that the C-SSRS performed adequately in correctly classifying any suicide-related behavior within 6 months of discharge from the hospital (AUC = 0.757, P < .001) with the total score and summary score from the ideation/behavior factor providing the best balance between sensitivity (0.694) and specificity (0.652-0.674). Conclusions: This study is the first to assess the factor structure of the C-SSRS in a large, high-risk sample. The measure has solid psychometric properties and merits use as a suicide risk assessment measure. © Copyright 2016 Physicians Postgraduate Press, Inc.";Journal of Clinical Psychiatry;10.4088/JCP.15m10069;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

One hundred and twenty nine consecutive inpatients with mental illness completed the SHSS (a 16-item measure assessing death thoughts, suicidal ideation and behavior in the last 12 months and lifetime except in the last 12 months), the Mini International Neuropsychiatric Interview, the Beck Hopelessness Scale, and the Gotland Male Depression Scale. SHSS scores had high correlations with commonly used measures in the field of suicide risk assessment. The ROC curves indicated that the SHSS performed well in classifying cases based on their current suicide status (suicide attempt in the last 24-48 hours). The SHSS is a valid and reliable instrument for assessing suicide risk. © International Academy for Suicide Research.;Archives of Suicide Research;10.1080/13811118.2011.540471;English;3;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM

In this study, we examined the psychometric properties of the SBQ-R and a new Chinese version of the instrument (C-SBQ-R) for college student samples. We used the culture, comprehension, and translation bias (CCT) procedure to examine the responses of independent Chinese college student samples who completed the C-SBQ-R (N1 = 298) and the SBQ-R (N2 = 292) and a U.S. college student sample (N3 = 320) who completed the SBQ-R.We found that the samples’ C-SBQ-R and SBQ-R scale scores showed acceptable internal consistency reliability estimates, factor structures, and concurrent validity estimates. Measurement invariance was established across groups differing in (a) language but not culture, (b) culture but not language, and (c) both language and culture. Receiver operating characteristic curve analysis results showed that the cutoff score of 7 was similar for both the C-SBQ-R and the SBQ-R in screening for suicide-related thoughts and behaviors. Our findings provided empirical support that the psychometric properties of the C-SBQ-R and the SBQ-R are similar; both could be used to assess the suicide-related thoughts and behaviors constructs. © 2022.

The current study aimed to develop a scale to provide accurate assessment and monitoring of functional recovery for people following a recent suicide attempt at The Way Back Support Service in Australia. Method: The study was conducted in multiple iterative stages: (1) literature review to identify existing scales; (2) structured informant interview with people with lived experience of a suicide attempt; (3) expert survey of researchers, clinicians, and people with lived experience on relevance and acceptability of candidate items; and (4) quantitative survey of the pilot scale to assess psychometric properties. Results: An 11-item scale assessing recovery in people who have recently attempted suicide was demonstrated to be a unidimensional measure with sound psychometric properties (? = 0.94). The scale was highly acceptable to researchers, clinicians, and people with lived experience. A short-form 6-item scale was also developed. Conclusions: The Functioning and Recovery Scale is likely to be useful for evaluating suicide prevention programs. No existing scale captures the broad construct of psychosocial functioning with sound psychometric rigor and the involvement of people with lived experience of suicide attempt. © 2020 The American Association of Suicidology";Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior;10.1111/sltb.12656;English;6;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;in the manuscript/SM

Research to date supports the scale's factor structure, internal consistency, and construct validity. The present study tested the scale's prospective validity for suicide attempts among 97 military personnel presenting to an emergency department or psychiatric outpatient clinic for an unscheduled walk-in evaluation. Method: Cox regression and receiver operator characteristic analyses were conducted to test the prospective validity of the SCS. Results: Results supported the prospective validity of the SCS (area under the curve [AUC] = 0.69) and indicate the scale's performance is comparable to an empirically supported measure of suicide ideation (AUC = 0.75). The SCS performance was not reduced by removing items containing the word suicide. Limitations: Homogeneous sample comprised of US soldiers, predominantly male, with recent suicidal ideation. Conclusion: Results support the SCS as an indicator of subsequent risk for suicidal behavior when used in acute care settings, and suggest the scale's performance is similar to more traditional suicide risk screening methods that depend on honest self-disclosure of suicidal thoughts. © 2019 Hogrefe Publishing.;Crisis;10.1027/0227-5910/a000639;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

Method: Convergent, divergent, and predictive validity of the C-SSRS were examined using secondary data from a study of veterans who presented to the psychiatric emergency room (n = 237). Data were collected 1 week, 1 month, 3 months, and 6 months following emergency room discharge. Results: Results demonstrated good evidence for convergent and divergent validity. Baseline intensity subscale scores predicted actual and interrupted attempts, and any behavior for all available data and for the subsample who had 6-month follow-up data, and also predicted preparatory behavior in the full sample. Baseline severity subscale scores predicted preparatory behavior and any behavior for the full sample and for those with 6 months of follow-up, and actual attempts for the full sample. Severity of ideation cutoff scores was significantly associated with actual attempts and any behavior in both samples. Adding a prior behavior criterion demonstrated similar results. Conclusions: Findings suggest that the C-SSRS is a psychometrically sound measure that can be used to augment suicide risk assessment with veterans who are already identified to be at risk for suicide. © 2018 The American Association of Suicidology;Suicide and Life-Threatening Behavior;10.1111/sltb.12515;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;
88;2019;"Yusuf, N.R.; Sabarinah; Thabrany, H.";Development of a risk-factors questionnaire to assess suicidal ideation among high school students of DKI Jakarta Province, Indonesia;"Background: Globally, suicide is a cause of premature death among young people. A survey done in Indonesia’s students revealed that suicidal thought was experienced by around 5%. In Jakarta, a 2015 preliminary study found a higher figure of 18.6% of high school student experienced suicidal ideation. This demonstrated an urgent need for intervention in the prevention and progression from suicidal ideation to suicide attempts. Therefore, this study aims to develop an instrument, named as The Risk Factors of Suicidal Ideation, for early detection of risk factors of suicidal thought in students. Method: This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2018 in Jakarta Province. A research-based, self-administered questionnaire was developed to assess the risk of suicide in high-school students. The study sample comprised 910 students from 10 high schools; the schools were chosen through stratified random sampling. Some statistical analysis was used to show the validity and reliability of this instrument. Results: This study produced a Risk Factors of Suicidal Ideation (RFSI) questionnaire consisting of 14 items incorporating four dimensions: belongingness, loneliness, hopelessness, and burdensomeness. The questionnaire achieved an 88.2% Cronbach’s alpha rating, indicating high reliability. Meanwhile, the instrument’s construct validity ranked high by Kaiser-Meyer-Olkin test (.812), and a Bartlett test score of <0.0001 confirmed the integrity of its factor analysis. Conclusion: The questionnaire is reliable and valid in assessing the risk factors of suicidal ideation among high-school students of Jakarta Province. Screening as part of an intervention strategy for suicide prevention can have an important role in decreasing suicidal ideation. © 2019, Indian Journal of Public Health Research and Development.

For this study, a psychometric harmonization between related suicide, depression, and anxiety symptom domains that provides a more balanced and complete spectrum of suicidal symptomatology was developed. The objective of this article is to describe the results of the early stages of computerized adaptive testing development for a suicide scale and pave the way for the final stage of validation. Methods: Data from psychiatric outpatients at the University of Pittsburgh and a community health clinic were collected from January 2010 through June 2012. 789 participants were enrolled in the calibration phase; 70% were female, and 30% were male. The rate of major depressive disorder as diagnosed by DSM-5 was 47%. The item bank contained 1,008 items related to depression, anxiety, and mania, including 11 suicide items. Data were analyzed using a bifactor model to identify a core dimension between suicidal ideation, depression, anxiety, and mania items. A computerized adaptive test was developed via simulation from the actual complete item responses in 308 subjects. Results: 111 items were identified that provided an extension of suicidality assessment to include statistically related responses from depression and anxiety domains that are syndromally associated with suicidality. All items had high loadings on the primary suicide dimension (average = 0.67; range, 0.49–0.88). Analyses revealed that a mean of 10 items (5–20) had a correlation of 0.96 with the 111-item scale, with a precision of 5 points on a 100-point scale metric. Preliminary validation data based on 290 clinician interviews revealed a 52-fold increase in the likelihood of current suicidal ideation across the range of the Computerized Adaptive Test Suicide Scale (CAT-SS). Conclusions: The CAT-SS is able to accurately measure the latent suicide dimension with a mean of 10 items in approximately 2 minutes.

The study was conducted in 2014 on a sample of 85 adolescents (90.6% females) who participated at follow-up (85.9%) out of the 99 (49.7%) baseline respondents. All adolescents were recruited from a specialized suicide-prevention clinic in Denmark. Through multivariate logistic regression analyses, we examined whether baseline suicidal behavior predicted subsequent suicidal behavior (actual attempts and suicidal behavior of any type, including preparatory acts, aborted, interrupted and actual attempts; mean follow-up of 80.8 days, SD = 52.4). Furthermore, we examined whether suicidal ideation severity and intensity incrementally predicted suicidal behavior at follow-up over and above suicidal behavior at baseline. Actual suicide attempts at baseline strongly predicted suicide attempts at follow-up. Baseline suicidal ideation severity and intensity did not significantly predict future actual attempts over and above baseline attempts. The suicidal ideation intensity items deterrents and duration were significant predictors of subsequent actual attempts after adjustment for baseline suicide attempts and suicidal behavior of any type, respectively. Suicidal ideation severity and intensity, and the intensity items frequency, duration and deterrents, all significantly predicted any type of suicidal behavior at follow-up, also after adjusting for baseline suicidal behavior. The present study points to an incremental predictive validity of the C-SSRS suicidal ideation scales for short-term suicidal behavior of any type among high-risk adolescents. © 2017, Copyright © International Academy for Suicide Research.";Archives of Suicide Research;10.1080/13811118.2016.1222318;English;3;1;0;0;1;1;0;0;0;repositorio institucional
117;2016;"Chang, E.C.; Chang, O.D.";Development of the Frequency of Suicidal Ideation Inventory: Evidence for the Validity and Reliability of a Brief Measure of Suicidal Ideation Frequency in a College Student Population;The present research focused on the development of a brief measure of suicidal ideation frequency, namely, the Frequency of Suicidal Ideation Inventory (FSII). Study 1 examined the latent structure of the FSII in a sample of 399 US college students. Results of exploratory factor analysis indicated a one-factor solution accounting for 86.96 % of the variance. Study 2 provided support for the internal reliability of the FSII across four different international samples (viz., US, Turkey, Hungary, and China). Within the US sample, the FSII was found to possess good 6-week test–retest reliability. Moreover, an examination of the associations between the FSII and important measures of suicide risk factors (e.g., suicidal behaviors) and suicide protective factors (e.g., flourishing) provided support for the construct validity of our new measure in an independent sample of 143 US college students. In addition, we found preliminary evidence supporting the FSII as a useful measure of the likelihood of making a future suicide attempt and evidence for the utility of the FSII over established measures of suicide risk in predicting depressive symptoms. Overall, the present findings provide promising evidence for the validity and reliability of the FSII as a brief measure of SI frequency in adults. © 2016, Springer Science+Business Media New York.;Cognitive Therapy and Research;10.1007/s10608-016-9758-0;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;

149;2010;"Naud, H.; Daigle, M.S.";Predictive validity of the suicide probability scale in a male inmate population;This paper describes the predictive power of the Suicide Probability Scale (SPS) within a male inmate population. The SPS scores of 1,047 inmates from 1995 to 1996 were compared against their suicidal behaviors in the following 10 years. The SPS probability score and the scores on its four subscales were found to be significantly higher in the group that engaged in at least one of three types of suicidal behavior: suicide, non-lethal self-harm and serious suicidal intentions. However, the SPS did not discriminate the inmates who went on to commit suicide. The SPS's capacity to predict suicidal behavior proved limited in terms of sensitivity. In this regard, the SPS's low and high risk levels correctly identified 36% of inmates who later engaged in suicidal behavior. The specificity was 0.85. These results confirm the SPS's predictive power with male prisoners. These findings are the first to demonstrate the predictive validity of the SPS. © 2009 Springer Science+Business Media, LLC.;Journal of Psychopathology and Behavioral Assessment;10.1007/s10862-009-9159-8;English;1;1;0;0;0;;;;0;
